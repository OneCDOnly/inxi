Bug fixes, new features!! Update now!! Or don't, it's up to you.

Bugs:
1. Let's call some of the android fixes and debugger failures bugs, why not?
Those are fixed. Note that many of these fixes will impact any system that is
ARM based, not just android.

Fixes:
1. Related to issue #226 which was a fine issue, fine tuned the debugger debuggers
to allow for smoother handling of /sys parse failures. Also added debugger filters
for common items that would make the /sys parser hang, oddly, most seem to be in
/sys/power for android devices.

2. Added some fine-tunings for possible mmcblk storage paths, in some cases, an 
extra /block is added, which made inxi think mounted drives were unmounted. I've
never seen this extra /block except on mmcblk devices on android, but you never
know, it could be more widespread.

3. Also mainly related to android, but maybe other ARM devices, in some cases,
an errant 'timer' device was appearing as a cpu variant, which is wrong. That was
a corner case for sure, and part of the variant logic in fact uses timer values 
to assign the actual cpu variants, but it was wrong in this case because it was
....-timer-mem, not ...-timer, which led to non-existent CPU variants showing.

4. Issue #236 by ChrisCheney pointed out that inxi had never updated its default 
/proc/meminfo value to use the newer MemAvailable as default if present, which led 
to incorrect memory used values showing up. That's because back in the old days,
we had to construct a synthetic Memory used from MemFree, buffers, cache, etc, but that
wasn't always right, since sometimes the cache actually isn't available, often is,
but not always.
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773
This commit on the kernel explains it pretty clearly. 
Thanks Chris for bringing this to our attention.

5. Kind of more future-proofing, got rid of a bunch of hard-coded strings internally
and switched those to use the row_defaults values, which is where string messages 
are supposed to go. That was mostly in the initial program check messages on start-up,
but also a few other stray ones. Also consolidated them a bit to get rid of redundant
messages, and added more variable based messages, like for missing/permissions on 
programs etc. The idea in general is that all the strings are contained in subs so 
that in theory they could be swapped for other strings, eg, languages, but honestly,
I no longer see this as very likely to ever happen. But it's still nice to be 
consistent internally and not get sloppy with english strings.

This also got rid of some largely redundant items in row_defaults, and expanded the 
list of handled events, and of variable based events, so it shouldn't be as necessary 
to add new row_defaults items for similar events.

Enhancements:
1. Debugger item to maybe try to find distro OEM, this was connected with issue #231 
but the issue poster vanished, and didn't do the work required, so this one won't 
happen until someone who cares [not me, that is] does the required work. 
It's always funny to see how quickly people vanish when they have to do the actual 
boring research that they want me to do for them, lol. Or maybe, sigh is more 
appropriate than lol. But it is pretty much par for the course, sad to say.
Or maybe this was an OEM hoping to have someone do their corporate work for them
for free, who knows. Anyway, there's a certain category of items that I'm reasonably 
happy to implement, but NOT if I have to do all the boring research work, so such 
features being added will depend on the poster actually doing the boring work.

I've gotten burned on this a few times, cpu arch: for example, some guy said he'd
track that and provide updates, he never even made it to the first release, so I got
stuck doing that one forever after. But that one at least has some general value, so
that's ok more or less, but I definitely won't take on stuff that I really don't 
personally care at all about unless the person requesting the feature does all the work
beforehand. The boring part, that is....

2. Related to issue #226, much improved android ID and many small android fixes for 
machine data etc. Now uses /system/build.prop for some data, which is a nice source,
sadly, most modern android devices seem to be locked down, with both build.prop and 
/sys locked down, which makes inxi unable to actually get any of that data, but if
your device either does not have these root only readable, or if you have an android 
rooted phone, the android support will be more informative. 

Hint: if you run inxi in termux on your non rooted android device, and it shows 
you what android version you are using in System:... Distro: line, then your android 
is not locked down. I have one such phone, android 7.1, but I cannot say how usual
or non usual this is. The poster of issue #226 for instance had to root his android 
7 phone to get this data to display. So it seems to vary quite a bit.

Note that due to these file system lockdowns, in general, trying to do android arm 
support remains largely a waste of time, but on some devices sometimes, you can now 
get quite nice system info. As I noted in the issue, if I can't get the features to
work on a non rooted phone in my possession, I'm probably not going to try to do the 
work because it's too hard to try to work on android issues without having the device 
in front of you for testing and debugging. In this case, one of my phones did work, so 
I did the work just to see where android is at now.

Android showed some slightly odd syntaxes for some devices, but those are now handled 
where I got a dataset for them that revealed the changes required.

3. Also related to issue #226 for termux in android, will show -r info.
That's an apt based package manager, but termux puts the apt files somewhere else so 
needed to change paths if those alternate paths existed for apt.

4. Added PARTFLAGS to debugger to see what knd of data that will yield, that's
a lsblk key/value pair. 

5. Just because it's easy to do, added new -Ixxx item, wakeups: which is a 
subset of Uptime, this will show how many times the system has been woken from 
suspend since the last boot. If the system has never been suspended, shows 0.

6. Many more disk vendors and disk IDs. The list just never ends, possibly a 
metaphor for something, the endless spinning of maya, who knows?

7. Added newest known ubuntu release, hirsute, to buntu ID logic. Might as well 
catch them early, that will be 21.04.

Version: 3.1.08
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-10-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

Bug fixes, updates!!! Yes!! Why wait!!! Can't stay frozen forever!

Bugs:
1. Not an inxi bug, but a weird change in defaults for ubuntu GNOME ENV 
variable values when running at least the gnome desktop, result to end
users appears to be a bug. This resolves issue #228
Note that so much weird non desktop data was put into those environmental
variables that inxi simply could make no sense of it. The fix was to make
the detections more robust, using regex instead of string compare, as well as
to at least try to strip out such corrupted data values, though that can never
be fully predictable. 
As far as I know, this issue only hits ubuntu gnome desktops, I've never seen these
value corruptions on any other distro, or on any other ubuntu desktop, though 
they may be there, but I'm not going to test all the ubuntu spins to find out.

I'm hoping the combination of logic fixes and junk data cleaning will handle
most future instances of these types of corruptions automatically. 

Again, this only happens on relatively laste ubuntu gnomes as far as I know.

Fixes:
1. An oversight, added sshd to list of whitelisted start clients. This permits 
expected output for: ssh <name@server> inxi -bay
that is, running inxi as an ssh command string. Should have done that a while ago,
but better late than never.
This corrects issue #227, or at least, has a better default, it worked fine before,
but required using --tty to reset to default terminal behavior. The problem is 
that if inxi can't determine what it's running in, it defaults to thinking it's
in an IRC client, and switches to IRC color codes, among other changes.
But it was nice to get sshd covered automatically so users don't have to know
the --tty option.

Changes:
1. More disk vendors and vendor IDs!!! Yes, that's right, the list never ends!!

Version: 3.1.07
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-09-29
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

Bug fixes, feature updates, changes!!

Bugs:
1. There was a glitch in the pattern that made -D samsung / seagate not ID right, 
fixed.

2. I  do not like calling this a bug, because it's not an inxi bug, it's an upstream
regression in the syntax used in /proc/version, they changed a fully predictable 
gcc version .... to a random series of embedded/nested parentheses and other random
junk. inxi tries to deal with this regression, which will be perceived as a bug in 
systems running kernel 5.8 or newer and inxi 3.1.06 or older, since it will fail to
show the kernel build compiler version since it can't find it in the string.

I really dislike these types of regressions caused by bad ideas done badly and 
without any thought to the transmitted knowledge base, but that's how it goes, 
no discipline, I miss the graybeards, who cared about things like this.

Fixes:
1. more -D nvme id changes, intel in this case.

2. FreeBSD lsusb changed syntax, which triggered a series of errors when run. 
[hint bsd users, do NOT file issues that you want fixed and then not provide 
all the data required in a prompt and timely manner, otherwise, really,
why did you file the issue?].

Note: the fix basically just rejects any row from lsusb that does not have the 
expected syntax/value in the expected place, which was I think the right 
solution given that the change was random, broke expected syntax for lsusb, and 
wasn't really integrateable into existing inxi usb logic, so why fight it? 
Given that at least 99.99% of all lsusb output in the world, including by the 
way OpenBSD's [not sure about most recent version], shows the expected values in 
the expected place, I could see no value in creating a convoluted work-around 
for a non core bsd tool in the first place, so that's what I didn't do.

See the README.txt for what to do to get issues really handed in BSDs.

Changes:
1. -C 'boost' option changed from -xxx feature to -x feature. 
Consider it a promotion!

2. Added --dbg 19 switch to enable smart data debugging for -Da.

3. Some new tools to handle impossible data values for some -D situations for SMART
where the smart report contains gibberish values, that was issue #225 -- tools were
convert_hex and is_Hex. The utility for these is limited, but might be of use in 
some cases, like handling the above gibberish data value.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New features, new changes, new bug fixes!!! Excitement!!! Thrills!!!

Bugs: 
1. Forgot to set get Shell logic in inxi short form, oops, so Shell remained blank, 
only inxi short, which I rarely use so I didn't notice.

2. Failed to test pacman-g2 for packages, had wrong query argument, so it failed. 
Also failed to test for null data, so showed errors for packages as well. Both  
fixed.

3. A big bug, subtle, and also at the same time, an enhancement, it turns out NVME
drives do NOT follow the age old /proc/partitions logic where if the minor number is
divisible by 16 or has remainder 8 when divided by 16, it's a primary drive, not 
a partition. nvme drives use a random numbering when > 1 nvme drives are present, and
the old tests would fail for all nvme drivers more than the first one, which led 
to wrong disk size totals. Thanks gardotd426 who took the time to help figure this
out in issue #223 - fix is to not do that test for nvme drives, or rather, to add 
a last fail test for nvme primary nvme[0-9]n[0-9] drive detections, not the minor 
number.

Fixes:
1. Corrected indentation for block sizes, children were not indented.

2. Updated some older inxi-perl/docs pages, why not, once in a while?

3. Kernel 5.8 introduces a changed syntax to gcc string location, this has been 
corrected, and the kernel gcc version now shows correctly for the previous 
syntax and the new one. Hopefully they do not change it again, sigh...

4. Removed string 'hwmon' sensors from gpu, those are not gpu sensors, and
are also usually not board/cpu sensors, but things like ath10, iwl, etc, 
network, or disk sensors, etc. In some cases hwmon sensor data would appear

Enhancements:
1. Big sensors refactor, now inxi supports two new sensors options:
--sensors-exclude - which allows you to exclude any primary sensor type[s]. Note that
in the refactored logic, and in the old logic, gpu sensors were already excluded.
Now other hardware specific sensors like network are excluded as well.

--sensors-use - use ONLY list of supplied sensor IDs, which have to match the
syntax you see in lm-sensors sensors output.

Both accept comma separated list of sensors, 1 or more, no spaces.

The refactor however is more far reaching, now inxi stores and structures data
not as a long line of sensors and data without differentiation, but by sensor array/chip
ID, which is how  the exclude and use features can work, and how granular default 
hardware sensor exclusions and uses can happen. This is now working in the gpu
sensors, and will in the future be extended to the newer 5.7/5.8 kernel disk 
temperature sensors values, which will lead in some cases to being able to get 
sensors data for disks without root or hddtemp. This is a complicated bit of logic,
and I don't have time to do it right now, but the data is now there and stored
and possible to use in the future.

To see sensors structures, use: inxi -s --dbg 18 and that will show the sensors data 
and its structures, which makes debugger a lot easier for new features.

This issue was originally generated by what was in my view an invalid complaint 
about some inxi sensors defaults, which led me to look more closely at sensors
logic, which is severely lacking. More work on sensors will happen in the future,
time, health, and energy permitting. 

2. Added Watts, mem temp, for amdgpu sensors, as -sxxx option. More gpu sensor
data will be added as new data samples show what will be available for the 
free modules like amdgpu, nouvean, and the intel graphics modules.

3. More disk vendors and IDs, as noted, the list never ends, and it hasn't ended,
so statement remains true. Thanks linux-lite hardware database.

Changes:

1. This has always bugged me since it was introduced, the primary cpu line starter 
Topology: which was only technically accurate for its direct value, not its children,
and also, in -b, cpu short form was using the value as the key, which is a no-no, 
I'd been meaning to fix that too, but finally realized if I just make the primary 
CPU line key be 'Info:', which is short, yet non-ambiguous, it would solve both
problems. 
To keep the -b cpu line as short as before, I removed the 'type:' and integraged 
that value into the primary Info: string:
CPU:
  Info: 6-Core AMD Ryzen 5 2600 [MT MCP] speed: 2750 MHz min/max: 1550/3400 MHz 
  
-b 3.1.05 and earlier:
CPU:
  6-Core: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 type: MT MCP speed: 1515 MHz min/max: 1550/3400 MHz
  
These resolve something that has irked me for quite a while, 'Topology:' didn't
fit, it was too geeky, and worst, it only applied to the value directly following
it, NOT to the rest of the CPU information. It also could not be shortened or
abbreviated since then it would have made no actual sense, like topo:, and the
same issue with value being used for key in -b, and wrong word for line starter
in -C would have existed. Besides, someone might think I was trying to make a 
subtle reference to the great Jodorowsky film 'El Topo', which would be silly,
because that's art, and this is just some system specs that are reasonably 
readable...

2. Was using opendns for WAN dig IP address, but apparently cysco bought that 
company, and now I've noticed the old opendns dig queries were failing more and
more, so replaced that with akamai dig requests.
Also made the WAN IP fallback to HTTP IP method if dig failed. New option:
--no-http-wan and config item NO_HTTP_WAN with override --http-wan added to
let you switch off http wan IP requests if you want. Note that if dig fails,
you will get no wan ip address. 
Updated/improved error messages to handle this more complex set of wan ip 
options, so hopefully the error alert message will in most cases be right.

3. To future proof inxi, switched debugger upload location to ftp.smxi.org/incoming 
from the old techpatterns.com/incoming. Updated man/help to remove those urls too.

Version: 3.1.05
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-07-26
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

Bug fixes!!! New Features!! Why wait!!!

Bugs:
1. Issue #220 on github: inxi misidentified XFCE as Gnome. This was a kind of core
issue, and pointed to some logic that needed updating, and some inadequate 
assumptions made, and some too loose cascade of tests. Hopefully now xfce will
almost never get misidentified, and the other primary desktops ID'ed either from
$ENV or from xrop -root will be slightly more accurately identified as well.

Note that this fix creates a possibility for obscure misconfigured desktops to
be ID'ed wrong, but in this case, that will be technically a bug for them, but
with the new fixes, that situation will be cleaner to handle internally in the
desktop ID logic.

Also tightened the final Gnome fallback detection to not trigger a possible
false positive, it was testing for ^_GNOME but that is not adequate, because
some gnome programs will trigger these values in xprop -root even if GNOME 
is not running. Should be safer now, hopefully no new bugs will be triggered
by these changes.

Fixes:
1. Missed an indentation level for -y1, gcc alt should have been indented in
one more level, now it is.

2. In disk vendors/family, didn't clean items starting with '/', this is
now corrected. Yes, some do, don't ask me why. Might be cases like:
Crucial/Micron maybe, where the first ID is grabbed, not sure.


Enhancements:
1. New Disk vendors, vendor IDs!!! The list never ends!!! We've finally found
infinity, and it is the unceasing wave of tiny and not so tiny disks and their
Ids.

2. New feature: for -Aa, -Na/-na/-ia, -Ga, now will add the modules the kernel
could support if they were available on the Device-x lines of those items.
This was made an -a option because it really makes no sense, if it's a regular
option, users might think that for example an nvidia card had a nouveua driver
when it didn't, when in fact, all the kernel is saying is that it knows those
listed modules 'couid' be used or present. This corresponds to the Display:
item in -Ga, that lists 'alternate:' drivers that Xorg knows about that could
likewise be used, if they were on the system.

In other words these are --admin options because otherwise users might get confused,
so this is one where you want to know the man explanation before you ask for it.

It is useful however if you're not sure what your choices are for kernel modules.

When the alternate driver is the same as the active driver, or if none is found,
it does not show the alternate: item to avoid spamming.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man, huge update, bug fixes, cleanups, updates!! 

What started as a relatively minor issue report ended up with a refactor of big 
chunks of some of the oldest code and logic in inxi.

So many bugs and fixes, updates, and enhancements, that I will probably miss some 
when I try to list them.

Bugs:
1. In the process of fixing an issue about sudo use triggering server admin
emails on failure, when --sudo/--no-sudo and their respective configuration
items were added, sudo was inadvertently disabled because the test ran before
the options were processed, which meant the condition to set sudo data was 
always false, so sudo for internal use was never set. The solution was to
set a flag in the option handler and set sudo after options or configs run.

2. Issue #219 reported gentoo and one other repo type would fail to show
enabled repos, and would show an error as well, this was due to forgetting
to make the match test case insensitive. If only all bugs were this easy 
to fix!!

3. I'd seen this bug before, and couldn't figure out why it existed.
It turned out that the partition blacklist filters were running fine
in the main partition data tool, but I had forgotten to add in corresponding
lsblk partition data filters, lol, so when the logic went back and double
checked for missing partitions. This feature had been, if i remember right,
to be able to show hidden partitions, which the standard method didn't see,
but lsblk did, anyway, when the double check and add missing partitions
logic ran, inxi was putting back in the blacklisted partitions every time,
despite the original blacklists working well and as intended.
This was fixed by adding in all the required fs type blacklists, then
adding in comments above each black list reminding coders that if they
add or remove from one blacklist, they have to do the same on the other.

4. Found while testing something unrelated on older vm, the fallback
case for cpu bugs, which was supposed to show the basic /proc/cpuinfo
cpu bugs, was failing inexplicably because the data was simply being
put into the wrong variable name, sigh.

Fixes:
1. While not technically an inxi bug, it would certainly appear that way to 
anyone who triggered it. We'd gotten issue reports before on this, but they 
were never complete, so couldn't figure it out. Basically, if someone puts 
inxi into a simple script that is in $PATH [this was the missing fact needed to
actually trigger this bug in order to fix it], the script [not inxi], will 
then enter into an endless loop as inxi queries it for its version number using
<script name> --version. This issue didn't happen if the script calling inxi
was not in PATH, which is why I'd never been able to figure it out before.

Only simple scripts with no argument handlers could trigger this scenario,
and only if they were in PATH.

Fixing this required refactoring the entire start get_shell_data logic, which
ended up with a full refactor of the program_version logic as well. The fix
was to expand the list of shells known by inxi so it would be able to recognize
when it was in a shell running a script running inxi.

This resulted in several real improvements, for instance, inxi will now almost
always be able to determine the actual shell running inxi, even when started 
by something else. It will also never use --version attempts on programs it does
not know about in a whitelist.

So we lose slightly the abilty to get version data on unknown shells, but we 
gain inxi never being able to trigger such an infinite loop situation.

2. As part of the program_version refactor, a long standing failure to get ksh,
lksh, loksh, pdksh, and the related posh shells, all of which ID their version
numbers only if they are running the command in themselves. The mistake had
been having the default shell run that command. These all now correctly identify
themselves.

3. As part of the wm upgrades, many small failures to ID version numbers, or
even wm's, in some cases, were discovered when testing, and corrected. Some
I had not tested, like qtile, and the lisp variants, were not being detected
correctly by the tests due to the way python or lisp items are listed in ps aux.

4. As part of the wm update and program_version refactor, updated and simplified
many desktop and wm detections and logic blocks. Ideally this makes them more
predictable and easy to work on for the future.

5. As some last tunings for the new -y1 key: value pair per line output option,
fixed some small glitches in -b indentation. Also improved RAID indenting,
and Weather, and made it all very clean and predictable in terms of indentations.

6. Something I'd slightly noticed but never done anything about, while testing
desktop fixes, I realized that for Desktop: item, dm: is a secondary data type,
but if it's Console:, then DM: is a primary data type, not a secondary one. So
now if Console: it becomes DM: which makes sense, previously it implied a dm:
was used to start the console, which was silly. Also, since often the reason
it's Console: with no dm in the first place is that it's a server with no dm.
So now if console, and no dm detected, rather than showing DM: N/A it just 
doesn't show dm at all. Note that the -y1 display feature now makes catching
and correcting such logic and level assignments much easier since you can 
see the error in the indentations directly.

7. As part of the overall core refactor, the print_data logic was also refactored
and simplified, by making -y1 a first class citizen, it led to significantly 
different way of being able to present inxi data on your screen, and now 
print_data logic is cleaner and reflects these changes more natively, all the
initial hacks to get this working were removed, and the logic was made to be
core, not tacked on.

8. A small thing also revealed in issue #219, battery data was not being
trimmed, not sure how I missed that, but in some cases, space padding was in the
values and was not removed, which leads to silly looking inxi output.

9. Several massive internal optimizations, which were tested heavily, led to
in one case, 8-900x faster execution the second time a data structure is used,
previously in program_values the entire list was loaded each time program_values
was called, now it's loaded into a variable on first load and the variable is
used for the tests after that. This was also done for the vendor_version for
disk vendors, which also features a very long data structure which can be 
loaded > 1 times for instances where a system has > 1 disk. 

I also tested while I was at it, to see if loading these types of data structures,
arrays of arrays, or hashes of arrays, by reference, or by dereferencing their 
arrays, was faster, and it proved that it's about 20% faster to not
dereference them, but to use them directly. So I've switched a number of the 
fixed data structures internally do use that method.

Another tiny optimization was hard resetting the print_data iterator hash,
while this would never matter in the real world, it showed that resetting 
the iterator hash manually was slightly more efficient than resetting it
with a for loop.

10. While  not seen inside inxi, I updated and improved a number of the vm's
used to test inxi and various software detections, so now I have a good selection,
going back to 2008 or so, up to current. This is helpful because things like
shells and window managers and desktops come and go, so it is hard to test 
old detections on new stuff when you can't install those anymore. You'll see
these fixes in many of the less well known window managers, and in a few of 
the better known ones, where in some cases the detections were damaged.

11. As part of the program_version refactor, updated and fixed file based 
version detections, those, ideally, will almost never be used. Hopefully 
programmers of things like window managers, shells, and desktops, can
learn how to handle --version requests, even though I realize that's a lot
harder than copying someone's code and then rebranding as your own project, or
whatever excuse people have for not including a --version item in their software.

Enhancements:
1. As a result of the shell, start shell, shell parent refactors, inxi was able
to correctly in most cases determine also the user default shell and its version, 
so that was added as an -Ixxx option:
Shell: ksh v: A_2020.0.0 default: Bash v: 5.0.16

2. As part of the program_version refactor, a more robust version number 
cleaner was made, which now allows for much more manipulation of the version
number string, which sometimes contains, without spaces, non version number '
info right before the actual version.

3. Many more wm IDs were created and tested, and some old virtual machines 
that were used years ago were used again to test old window managers and 
their IDs, as well as new vms created to test newer ones. Many version
IDs and WM ids were fixed in this process as well. All kinds of new ones
added, though the list is basiclaly endless so ideally inxi would only use
its internal data tables for window managers that have actual users, or did.

4. First wayland datatype, now it may show Display ID: with -Ga, so far that's
the only wayland screen/display data I can get reliably.

5. As part of the shell parent/started in: updates and fixes, added every shell
I could find, and installed and tested as many of them as possible to verify
that either they have no version method, or that their version method works.
This shell logic also is used to determine start parent. Obviously using
whitelists of things that can change over time isn't ideal, but there was no
way to actually do it otherwise. The best part of the fixes is that it's now 
remarkably difficult to trick inxi into reporting the wrong shell, and it
generally will also get the default shell right, though I found cases in
testing where a shell when started replaces the value in $SHELL with itself.

6. I found a much faster and reasonably reliable way to determine toolkits 
used by gtk desktops, like cinnamon, gnome, and a few others. Test is to
get version from gtk-launcher, which is MUCH faster than doing a package
version query on the random libgtk toolkit that might be tested, and actually
was tested for pacman, apt, and rpm in the old days, but that was removed
because it was a silly hack. It's possible that now and then gtk desktops
will be 0.0.1 versions off, but in most cases, the version matched, so I decided
to restore the tk: item for a selection of gtk or gnome based desktops.

So now gtk desktops, except mate, which of course will be using gtk 2 for a 
while longer, toolkit version should be working again, and the new method
works on everything, unlike the old nasty hack that was used, which required
package queries and guessing at which gtk lib was actually running the desktop,
it was such a slow nasty hack that it was dumped a while ago, but this new
method works reliably in most cases and solves most of the issues.

7. As part of the overall program_versions refactor, the package version 
tester tool was extended to support pacman, dpkg, and rpm, which in practical
terms covers most gnu/linux users and systems. Since this feature is literally
only used for ASH and DASH shell version detections, it was really just added
as a proof of concept, and because it fit in well with the new Package counts
feature of -I/-r.

8. Updated for version info a few other programs, added compositors as well.

9. Last but not least!! More disk vendor IDs, more disk vendors!! And found
another source to double check vendor IDs, that's good. 

New Features:
1. For -Ix/-rx, -Ixx/-rxx, -Ia/-ra, now inxi shows package counts for most
package managers plus snap, flatpak, and appimage. I didn't test appimage so
I'm not 100% sure that works, but the others are all tested and work.

If -r, Packages shows in the Repos item as first row, which makes sense, packages,
repos, fits. Note that in some systems getting full package counts takes some
time so it's an -x option not default. 
If -rx, -rxx, -ra, package info moved to -r section, and if -Ix, -Ixx, or -Ia,
the following data shows:
 * -Ix or -rx: show total package counts: Packages: 2429
 * -Ixx or -rxx: shows Packages then counts by package manager located. If there
 was only one package manager with packages, the total moves from right after 
 Packages: to the package manager, like: Packages: apt: 3241 but if there were
 for example 2 or more found, it would show the total then:
 Packages 3245 apt:3241 snap: 4
 * -Ia or -ra: adds package managers with 0 packages managed, those are not
 shown with -xx, and also shows how many of those packages per package manager
 is a library type lib file.

Version: 3.1.03
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-06-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

Big internal refactor!! Fully adjustable indentation logic, built in, native!

NOTE: none of these changes have any impact on normal inxi -y -1, -y, or -y xx
operation, everything will remain exactly the same, this only changes and
makes robust -y 1 single key: value pair per line output.

3.1.03 finishes the -y1 introduced in 3.1.02, but makes it a core part of the inxi
logic for line printing, not a tacked on afterthought.

Because the first draft of this in 3.1.02 was really a hack tacked onto the existing
logic, which was not very flexible or robust, and required way too much literal test
logic in the black box print_data() subroutine, which is supposed to be a 'dumb'
logic, that just does what you give it automatically, I added in key changes that
hard code the indentations per key, like so:

Now: 34#0#3#key-name
Before: 34#key-name

Note that anyone using the json or XML output option may need to redo their code
a bit to handle these extra 2 values that preface the actual key names.

Fixes:
1. In order to make this work, changed a few small things internally, a few
key names were slightly altered to make them more clear.

Changes:
1. Redo of all internal full key strings, added two new # separated items:
 xx#x#y#key-name:
  * xx remains the main 0 padded 2 digit sorter per row/block.
  * x is a new 0/1 boolean, that shows if the value is a container or not. As 
    currently implemented probably not hugely useful since it won't say when
    the following items it is a container of ends.
    Note that the following y value will always be 1 for the item contained by
    the container, so you can check that way if you want. the next item can
    also be a container, but it would have either the same indentation level
    as the previous container or be different.
    Thus, if a key is a container, it can contain either non containers, or
    other containers, but that primary container does not end until the indent
    value equals or is less than the indent value of the first container.
    If you are a programmer you should be able to figure this out.
  * y is the indentation level, 0-xx is supported, but in practical terms, only 
    4 levels are used. For single line output, these set the indentation for that
    key.
  * key-name remains the key string ID name.
  
2. For -y 1 -G will show drivers then indented one more level unloaded, FAILED,
and alternate: to make it clear those are a subset of drivers. driver: itself
will contain the actual driver. In cases where no driver is loaded, a note
will show indented after driver:

3. For -y 1, driver v: versions will be indented 1, and driver will be a container
that contains that version key: value pair.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.1.02
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-06-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

Big change, cleanup, small bug fixes. Hot, grab it now!!

The new -y 1 feature exposed several small and larger glitches with how sets 
of data were constructed in inxi output. See Changes: for list of changes made
to improve or fix these glitches.

These errors and minor output inconsistencies became very obvious when I was
doing heavy testing of -y 1, so I decided to just fix all of them at the same
time, plus it was very hard to make the -y 1 indenter work as expected when the 
key values were not being treated consistently.

Note that this completes the set of all possible -y results:

Full -y Options:
1. -y [no integer given] :: set width to a default of 80. this is what you usually
want for forum posts, or for online issue reports, because it won't wrap and be 
hard to read. Help us help your users and others!! Teach them to use for example
-Fxzy or -bay for their bug reports. Just add y to whatever collection of arguments
you generally ask for in support forums or issue reports. Highly recommended,
easy to type, and joins cleanly with other letters.

2. -y -1 :: removes line width limits, this can lead to very long lines in some 
cases, and removes all auto-wrapping of line widths.

3. -y 1 :: Switch to stacked key: value pairs, with primary data blocks separated
by a blank line. Think dmidecode type output, or other command line sys info tools.
By request, a forum support guy noted it was hard for newbies to understand the 
-G values, particularly -Ga when in lines, so this is another way to request
data. WARNING: for lots of data, this gets really long!!! But if you are curious
how inxi actually constructs its data internally, this sort of shows it.

4. -y 80-xx :: set width to 80 or greater. Note you can also set these in
your configurations if you want using the various options supported.

-----------------------------------

Bugs:
1. Once again, no real bugs found beyond a few trivial things I can't remember.

Fixes:
1. When out of X, dm: showed after Console: and often said dm: N/A particularly
on headless servers, which was silly. Now DM: only shows after Console: if
a DM: was actually found. If regular Desktop output, either in X, or via 
--display out of X, no changes.

2. There was a pointless sudo test when sudo values are set initially, they
were still running even if --no-sudo was used. Now they don't run in that case.

Enhancements:
1. The biggie, now inxi can output in a similar indented way as something like
dmidecode if you use the -y 1 option. This feature was originally by request,
though the initial request actually just wanted to see it stacked simply, 
but that was almost impossible to read for any output reasonably long, so
I made the indentations very dynamic and deep, they go up to 4 levels in,
which is roughly how deep in the inxi sub Categories go. This output format
makes it very easy to see how inxi 'thinks' about its data, how it views
sets, subsets, subsubsets, and subsubsubsets of data.

Note that each data block, as with dmidecode data, is separated by a blank
line. You know what this means!!! Yes, that's right!!! You can parse inxi
output with awk!!, same way legacy bash+gawk inxi used to parse its data!! 
Or if your brain just does not like lines of data, you can make it appear in
indented single key: value pairs.

Here you can see for example that 1 Xorg Display has 1 or more Screens,
and each Screen has one or more Monitors. Note that this -Ga data first
appeared in inxi 3.1.00.

Sample [with bug in OpenGL output!, and showing -Ga newer values as well
for dual monitor setup, with one Xorg Screen]:

  OpenGL: 
    renderer: N/A 
    v: N/A 
    direct render: N/A
    
2. Refactored and cleaned up print_data(), got rid of some early testing code,
dumped some unnecessary tests, simplified old tests, and optimized the new 
indentation logic reasonably well. Hopefully the print_data() will not be
quite as much of a black box now as it was.

3. Even more drive vendors and ID matches!!! The list never ends!! An endless
series of new vendors and IDs of existing vendors sprout up, then float away.
And inxi follows them to the best of its ability. Thanks again to Linux-Lite
hardware database, which help make this ever expanding list possible, since 
their users appear to use every disk known to humankind.

Changes:
1. When out of Display, and Console: shows, -S will not show dm: if no 
display manager is detected, and if it is detected, it shows DM: since it's 
not part of the Console: set of data. If out of X and --display is used to
get Xorg data out of X, it will show Desktop: set of data as normal, at least
it will show the stuff it can find. This resolves the issue where dm: appeared
to be a member of the set of Console: data, instead of either its own thing,
DM:, or a member of the set of Desktop: data. 

2. For RAID Devices with sub Array-x: values, Array-x: is capitalized, it used
to be array-x: That was silly.

3. In USB, now Device-x: resets inside each Hub: so that the Device-x: are
numbered starting at 1 within each Hub:. This makes the counter behavior act 
the same as it does in for example RAM Array-x: / Device-y:, where each Array-x:
resets Device-y: count to 1. This changes the old default of having Device-x:
not reset, to let you see the total number of devices plugged in or attached
no matter which hub they were plugged into, but the output actually gets 
sort of confusing in single key: value pair mode per line.

4. The key: value syntax for weather was changed completely, now it works
like the rest of the features, with Report:... [Forecast:...] Locale:...
and Source:. Locale makes the source of the times and other date related
features, and the location if shown or available, much more obvious. Before
it was never clear if Current Time referred to your local or the remote 
time, now it's clearly from the Locale: you specified with -W, or 
the default -w local info. Also made Report 1 line if unwrapped, Forecast 1 
line if not wrapped, and Locale: 1 line if not wrapped, which makes the output
easier to read. 

NOTE: automated weather queries are NOT allowed, if you do it, you will be
banned!! inxi is NOT a desktop weather app!! Don't confuse it with one!!
Weather is just a small service to users who might for example want to check
the weather on a remote system, or something like that, and is not intended
to be used on a routine basis. 

5. Cleaned up and re-ordered the --version output. It had some pretty old
contexts in the language, which were removed or cleaned up and brought up to
date. If you're wondering, I roughly use rsync and nano --version as guides
for what to show or not show there.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.1.01
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-05-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New inxi, man. New information types, fixes, man updates.

Bugs:
No bugs of any importance fixed or found!!

Fixes:
1. Tiny fix, didn't use partition/slice assignment in help menu. BSD 
interest only since default partition is standard for Linux.

Enhancements:
1. Disc Vendors: added a large number of possible disk vendors, without having
actual detection data available for all of them, using a different source. 
Also added, as usual, more disc vendor IDs from linux-lite hardware database, 
always ready with more vendors!
2. Added groovy gorilla ID for ubuntu
3. Very nice usability change, mostly for support people, now if -y without
an integer is supplied, it will assign default column width of 80, which
is what you usually want for forums or issue reports, otherwise the output
can wrap outside the post or issue report, which is hard to read. Hopefully
support people will catch onto this one.
4. This closes issue #217 - Adds dmidecode based extra data:
 -xxx - shows CPU voltage and external clock speeds
 -a - shows CPU socket type and base/boost: speed items. These are --admin
 options because neither is particularly reliable, sometimes they are right,
 sometimes they aren't, as usual with dmi data. As far as tests show, base 
 speed, what dmidecode misleadingly calls 'Current Speed', which it isn't,
 is the actual normal non throttled speed of the CPU / motherboard setup.
 boost is what dmidecode calls 'Max Speed', which it also isn't, though
 sometimes it is, as with AMD cpus with boost, and no overclocking. With
 overclocking, sometimes base will be higher, sometimes the actual real
 current cpu speeds will be higher than all the max/boost values.
 Motherboard CPU socket type is likewise randomly correct, incorrect, empty,
 misleading, depending on the age and type of the system, and the CPU
 vendor. It appears that in general, AMD CPUs will be more or less right
 if they have this data, and Intel CPUs will sometimes be right, sometimes
 not, or empty. For > 1 CPU systems, the data is much less reliable.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.1.00
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-04-22
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New inxi, new man. Huge update, new line types, huge graphics upgrade, new 
switches, bug fixes, glitch fixes, enhancements, you name it, this has got it!!

Note that since this features a new primary line item (-j / --swap Swap:), 
the version number has been bumped to 3.1.0, making this a major version 
upgrade, the first since the new Perl inxi rewrite was launched, though of 
course 3.0.0 contained many new line items as well, but this is the first 
actually new line item since then.

Bugs:
1. Big bug fix: if -z used, and -p, and user had partitions mounted in $HOME 
directory, the partitions would buggily duplicate in the output.

2. See Fix 1, inxi was reporting the wrong (or no in some cases) Xorg driver 
because it was using the wrong Xorg log, it was only searcing in the original 
/var/log/Xorg.0.log file, not the newer alternative path locations.

Fixes:
1. Both an enhancement and a fix, users reported Xorg log file location changes. 
Fix is that now inxi uses wildcard searches of all readable locations that can 
contain the log files, then collects a list of them, and uses the last modified
one. This ensures that the best possible guess is made about which actual 
log file is current, which should lead to significantly more reliable Xorg 
driver reports overall. 

Note that this fix works for user level and root level, it will always use the 
most recent readable file no matter what. For root, that should translate to 
the most recent on an absolute level Xorg log file. This issue was caused by 
gdm moving from Xorg.0.log to Xorg.1.log on some systems, but not all, and 
also, the location is often but not always now:
~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.[01234..].log [except for root, which is why 
root has to search for all user Xorg log files to find the most  recent one. 

There were many red-herrings in this issue report, so it took some research to 
dig through those to the real data sources.

2. Now that the compositor detection is out of early testing mode, enabled
always on compositor detection for Wayland systems. Since the compositor
is the Wayland display server, it makes sense to always show it if Wayland.
Note that there is still no known way to actually reliably get Wayland data
beyond simple environmental variables that let inxi detect Wayland is running
the desktop. Lack of reliable logs or debugging tools across Wayland compositors
makes this entire process about 10-50x more difficult than it should have been.

3. In keeping with 2., also moved compositor: item to be right after server: 
item.

4. Debian bug:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?dist=unstable;package=inxi
requested that HTTP::Tiny be set to default always check SSL certificates.
Now inxi does that, and --no-ssl flag disables this, which makes the Perl
http downloader now work roughly the same as wget, curl, etc.

5. Man page fixes, added pointer placeholders for out of alphabetical order
options, so you can find anything by looking down the alpha sorted lists, like:
--swap - See -j. Since inxi is running out of single letters that match new
features, it's easier to point man readers to the right item without them
having to already know it to find it. Also added --dbg [2-xx] pointer to
github inxi-perl/docs/inxi-values.txt so people interested can learn how to
trip the various per feature screen debuggers.

Enhancements:
1. updated ubuntu ids, added 'focal LTS'.

2. USB Graphic devices added. This will add support for USB graphics adapters, 
an uncommon but existing category, often used in SOC boards, for example, but 
also on desktops, and things like USB webcams. Leaving these off was really
just an oversight, the programming internally had the data, it just wasn't 
using it. 

3. Support added for TV card type multimedia devices in Graphics. That was 
actually a long term oversight, I'd simply missed that in the device ID 
documentation, one of the multimedia device subtypes is Video device.

4. Huge, massive, internal upgrade to allow for -Ga output, which gives a 
technically accurate Xorg > Display > Screen > Monitor breakdown. Note that 
Display and Screen data come from xdpyinfo, and Monitor info comes from xrandr, 
but if xrandr is missing, the Screen information shows. 

Technically for -G, -Gxx, end users see very little difference except the per 
Screen / per Monitor resolutions are listed with a 1: type counter per item. 

Note that Xorg Screens are NOT Monitors, they are a virtual space Xorg constructs
out of the pieces of hardware that make up the Screen space. In many cases, 
1 Xorg Screen contains only 1 Monitor, but the dimensions or dpi are frequenty 
different.

New output items: 
Display: ... display ID: [Xorg Screen identifier, like :0.0]; screens: [Total Xorg
Screens in current Display]; [s-default: [if > 1 Screens, default Screen number]]

Screen-x: [Screen number]; s-res: [Xorg Screen resolution];
s-dpi: [Xorg Screen dpi]; s-size: [Xorg Screen mm (inch) size; 
s-diag: [diagonal of Xorg Screen size] 

Monitor-x: [Monitor Xorg ID]; res: [Actual monitor pixel dimensions]; 
hz: [actual monitor reported frequency]; dpi: [actual monitor dpi as calculated
from actual monitor resolution/size; size: [actual monitor size in mm (inch); 
diag: [actual diagonal size in mm (inch).

4a. -Gxx now shows Xorg s-dpi: for the Screen as well, after the main resolution
section for -G.

5. Big improvement in error messages and logging for Xorg driver detections, 
this logic is much more robust now, but after the main driver fix, also much less
likely to ever be seen.

6. Almost not visible to users, but major internal graphics refactor allows now
for more modular treatment, and eventual Wayland data sourcing. Currently
most Wayland data sourcing is in stub form, or only logically possible, but
as it grows possible (if ever, since Wayland protocal appears to have totally
neglected enforcing single location logging, and single tool debugging for
the entire Wayland protocol of compositors, a massive oversight in my view).
The -Ga refactors internally made this much more possible, and I integrated
switches and tests, and fallbacks, and stubs in some locations, so it was 
clear where current Xorg specific logic is, and where future Wayland logic 
will fit in, sort of anyway.

7. Debugger tools added for new features, or most of them.

8. New primary line item: --swap / -j. This moves all swap data to a dedicated
Swap: line, which looks roughly the same as Partition: lines, but when -j/--swap
is used, all swap types, not only physical partition swaps, show. This should 
make some users happy.

9. Added more cpu family IDs for Zen 2 series of cpu, tweaked some later
Intel cpu family ids in terms of cpu arch name tool.

10. By request, added ability filter out all UUID or Partition Label
strings in -j, -o, -Sa, -p, -P. Those are tripped by --filter-label and
--filter-uuid. Mostly useful in fringe cases, for example, replacing
label or UUID from -Sa kernel boot parameters with root=LABEL=<filter>,
or in cases you want to show full -v8 output without showing UUID or Labels, 
whatever.

11. Added --no-dig/--dig plus configuration option NO_DIG=true. This disables
dig in cases where dig is installed but failed due to maybe network firewall
rules or something, and WAN IP detection fails. Normally you always want
to use dig, it's faster, more reliable, and safer, than all the other regular
downloader based methods, but we have seen server setups where for some reason
those types of dig requests were blocked, thus disabling WAN IP detection.

12. Added in WAN IP failure case, if dig was used, suggestion to try
again with --no-dig, since most users are unlikely to learn about this issue,
or the solution to it.

13. Added single letter shortcut -J for --usb, maybe this will help people
discover usb component of inxi, now you can request for instance: inxi -FJaz

14. Added xonsh to supported shells, that had tripped a perl undefined value
for start client bug since xonsh uses single word for version, xonsh/234
so the default value, 2nd word, was undefined. 

15. More SSD and USB drive vendors from the endless fountain over at 
Linux Hardware Database (linuxliteos.com). 

Changes:
1. Small change in how screen resolutions are output in -G non -a mode,
now each Screen / Monitor will increment by 1 the 1: [resolution~hz] key.
This helps make it more readable. Note that in non -a mode, the increments
are just based on Screen, then Monitor, Monitor, Screen, and so on, counts. 
Most users will only have one Screen systems, but more advanced setups may use
the Xorg > 1 Screen, each screen able to run > 1 monitors.

The counts in say, a 2 Screen system, with 3 monitors, would be:
1: res1 [from screen 0, monitor 1] 2: res2 [from screen 0, monitor 2] 
3: res3 [from screen 1, monitor 1.

If xrandr is not installed, it would show:
1: res1 [from screen 0] 2: res2 [from screen 1]

Version: 3.0.38
Patch: 00
Date: 2020-03-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, man page, exciting changes!!

Bugs:
1. Fixed undefined error that could happen, in rare cases, in hdd_temp logic.

Fixes:
1. Fixed Elbrus cpu nazming, model 9 is 8CV, not 8CB (Cyrillic error)
2. Preventitive, was not using '-' quite correctly in all regex ranges.
3. Had wrong desktop string listed in Unity
4. Reordered Family/Drive model in usb drive reports, it's to make it 
more obvious what is what.
5. Adjusted indexing of splits to get better results in corner cases.
6. Fixed some numbering issues.
7. Added trimming n1 from nvme0 type names for nvme, this corrects some 
issues users were having.
8. Fixed a division by 0 error in smartctl data grabber.
9. Fixed a Perl issue, didn't realize perl treats 000 as a string, not 0.
10. Another Perl fix, int() only wants to get numeric values sent to it,
I'd assumed a different behavior, non numerics get converted to 0, but that's
not how Perl sees things. Things like this, by the way, are why Perl is so
absurdly fast.

Enhancements:
1. More disk vendors. The list will never be complete!! We have found eternal
churn!! Thanks to linux lite hardware database as always.
2. Big one!!! Now inxi uses smartctl data, if installed, for getting advanced 
drive information (with -a). See man and help for details. Will show failing drives,
etc. Lots of info can be available, but sometimes data is not in smartctl db,
so inxi can't find it, that's not an inxi bug, it's just how it is.
3. Made hours on more human readable, into days/hours, for -a smartctl disk 
report.
4. Added $test[12] for smartctl data printout, and $test[13] for disk array print out.
Note that advanced debugger outputs can change or vary depending on what is being
worked on so don't in general rely on these always being around. But they do
tend to say stuck in place once I add them.
5. Added some nvme stuff, spare reserve, if you need it, you'll appreciate it,
if not, you'll never know it's there.
6. By request from some forum issue thread: made --host only be shown onif not 
--filter or not --host. This makes -z remove hostname, but retains ability to
do absolute overrides. Hostname should have always been filtered out like that,
it was an oversight. I think that was Manjaro who asked that, but I forget.
Note that this change, as usual, will not alter expected behaviors if users
have config item for hostname set.
7. Added support for picom compositor, thanks user codebling for that, I think
that's compiz fork, the real branch that is that is being developed.

Version: 3.0.37
Patch: 00
Date: 2019-11-19
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, man page, exciting changes!!

Bugs:
1. issue #200 - forgot to add all variants for -p, now works with --partition-full
and --partitions-full
2. issue #199 - another one, forgot to add --disk to -D for long version. Thanks
adrian15 for both of these, he was testing something and discovered these were 
missing.
3. Issue #187 an issue with RAID syntax not being handled in a certain case,
thanks EnochTheWise for following through on this one. This turned out to be 
a bad copy paste, a test pattern did not match the match pattern.

Fixes:
1. Fixed some docs typos.
2. Issue #188 fixed protections and filters for some glxinfo output handlers.
3. Issue #195, for Elbrus bit detection.
4. Added filter to cpu data, was not skipping if arm, so Model string
was treated numerically.

Enhancements:
1. Added rescatux to Debian system base detections. This closes issue #202, again 
from adrian15, thanks.
2. For cpu architecture, updated for latest AMD ryzen and other families, like 
Zen 3, which is just coming out re available data. Also latest Intel, which are 
trickier to ID right now, but I think I got the latest ones right,
That's things like coffee lake, amber lake, comet lake, etc.
3. Huge one, full (hopefully out of the box) Russian Elbrus CPU support. Thanks
to the alt-linux and the others who helped provide data and feedback to get support.
Note that this was also part of correcting 64 bit detection for e2k type, which
is how Elbrus IDs internally. See issue #197 which I've left open for the time
being for more information on this CPU and how it's now handled by inxi.
Note all available data should now work for Elbrus, including physical cpu/core
counts etc. Elbrus do not show flag information, nor do they use min/max speed,
so that data isn't available, but everything else seems to work well.
4. Eternal disk vendors. Thanks linux lite hardware database, you continue to
help make the disk vendor feature work by supplying every known vendor ever seen.
5. To close debian bug report https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942194
Note that the fix is simply to give the user the option to disable this behavior
with the new --no-sudo and NO_SUDO configuration file options. This issue should 
never have been filed as a bug since even the poster admitted it was a wishlist 
item, but because of how debian bug tracker works, it's hard to get rid of 
invalid bugs. Note that this is the internal use of sudo for hddtemp and file,
not starting inxi with sudo, so using this option or configuration item just
removes sudo from the command. Note that because the user did not do as 
requested, and never actually filed a github wishlist issue, and since his
request was vague and basically pointless, the fix is just to let you switch 
off sudo, that's all.
Note that another user had commented on sudo firing off admin emails on servers,
and that was in a different context, some time ago, that's what this option really
is useful for, if you want to just disable sudo fires internally to avoid admin
server email alerts, basically.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.36
Patch: 00
Date: 2019-08-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, many small fixes. 

Bugs:
1. Issue #188 exposed a situation in glxinfo where the required opengl fields are
present but contain null data. This happens when a system does not have the required
opengl drivers, which was the case here. inxi failed to handle that. Thanks 
LinuxMonger for posting the required data to figure this corner case out.

2. Fixed a long time bug in Disk vendor ID, there was an eq (string equals) 
where it was supposed to use regex pattern match. Oops. Would have led to 
disk vendor id failures in several cases.

Fixes:
1. help, man updates for RAM/Memory data, more clarifications.

2. Refactored RepoData class/package, to make it easier to handle repo string 
data, and make it all overall cleaner internally, and enable future extensions 
to certain features in inxi that may or may not one day become active.

3. Added to some regex compares \Q$VAR\E to disable regex characters in strings.
I should have used that a long time ago, oh well, better late than never!

4. Found a horrible case were xdpyinfo uses 'preferred' instead of the actual
pixel dimensions, shame on whoever allowed that output!!! shame! Had to add
a workaround to make sure numeric values are present, if not, then use the 
fallback, which means, 2x more data parsing to get data that should not 
require that, but in this example, it did (an Arch derivative, but it could 
be xdpyinfo itself, don't know).

Enhancements:
1. More fixes on issue #185. Thanks tubecleaner for finding and provding required 
data to really solve a set of RAM issues that apply particularly in production 
systems. This issue report led to 2 new options: --memory-short, which only 
shows a basic RAM report.

Memory:    RAM: total: 31.43 GiB used: 14.98 GiB (47.7%) 
           Report: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type: DDR4

And a 2nd, --memory-modules, only shows the occupied slots. This can be 
useful in situations where it's a server or vm with a lot of slots, most empty:

Memory:    RAM: total: 31.43 GiB used: 15.44 GiB (49.1%) 
           Array-1: capacity: 256 GiB slots: 4 EC: None 
           Device-1: DIMM 1 size: 16 GiB speed: 2400 MT/s 
           Device-2: DIMM 1 size: 16 GiB speed: 2400 MT/s

Note that both of these options trigger -m, so -m itself is not required.

2. More disk vendors!! The list never ends! Thanks linux-lite hardware database
and users for supplying, and buying/obtaining, apparently every disk known to
mankind.

3. Added fallback XFCE detection, in cases were the system does not have xprop 
installed, it's still possible to do a full detection of xfce, including toolkit,
so now inxi does that, one less dependency to detect one more desktop.

4. Added vmwgfx driver to xorg drivers list. Note, I've never actually seen this 
in the wild, but I did see it as the kernel reported driver from lspci, so it
may exist.

Unfixed:
1. Issue #187 EnochTheWise (?) did not supply the required debugger data so there
is a RAID ZFS issue that will not get fixed until the required debugger data is
supplied. 

Note that a key way we get issues here is from Perl errors on the screen, which are
a frequent cause of someone realizing something is wrong. This is why I'm not going
to do a hack fix for the RAID ZFS issue, then the error messages will go away, and
it will likely never get handled.

Version: 3.0.35
Patch: 00
Date: 2019-07-15
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Bug fixes, updates.

Bugs:
1. Issue #185 exposed a small long standing bug in ram max module size logic.
Was not retaining the value each loop iteration, which could lead to way off
max module size guesses. Note that this could lead to a VERY wrong max module size
report.
2. Issue #185 also exposed a rarely seen undefined value for ram reports, was 
not tested for undefined, now is.

Fixes:
1. cleanup of comments in start client debugger that made it unclear.
2. Got rid of all the legacy development modules that were in inxi-perl/modules.
These were totally out of date and pointless to retain.

Enhancements:
1. Added eoan ubuntu 19-10 release name
2. Added zen cpu model ID.
3. Disk vendors and new vendor IDs added. Thanks linuxlite hardware database.
4. Made a backend tool to check for new unhandled disks, this makes updating 
disk/vendor IDs a lot easier. 
5. Updated inxi-perl/docs with new links etc.

Version: 3.0.34
Patch: 00
Date: 2019-04-30
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man, new feature!! Bug fixes!

Bugs:
1. issue #182 - in freebsd, there was an oversight in the pciconf parser, it 
was using unfiltered strings as regex pattern, and of course, a string flipped
an error. Fix was to add the regex cleaner to the string before it's used in test.

2. NOTE: issue #182 had a second bug, but the issue poster didn't follow up with 
data or output so it couldn't be fixed. This was related to a syntax change in
usbdevs -v output in FreeBSD. Such changes are too common, but it might also 
simply be a variant I have not seen or handled, but so far no data, so can't fix.
Don't blame me if you get this bug, but do post requested debugger data if you
want it fixed!

Fixes:
1. Updated man for weather, explained more clearly how to use country codes for 
weather output. More clarifying in general about weather location, and weather
restrictions. 

Enhancements:
1. Added avx/avx2 to default flag list in -C short form. Thanks damentz from 
liquorix for clarifying why that was a good idea. Note the initial issue came up
in a Debian issue report, not here. People!! please post issues here, and don't bug 
maintainers with feature requests! Maintainers aren't in a position to add a feature,
so you should go straight to the source. 

1.a. Created in inxi-perl/docs new doc file: cpu-flags.txt, which explains all 
the flags, and also covers the short form flags and explains why they are used.

2. To resolve another issue, I made a new documentation file: 
inxi-perl/docs/inxi-custom-recommends.txt 
This is instructions for maintainers of distros who do not use rpm/apt/pacman but 
still want the --recommends feature to output their package pool package names for 
missing packages. I decided to not allow more than the default 3 package managers 
because no matter what people say, if I allow in more, the maintainer will vanish 
or lose interest, and I'll be stuck having to maintain their package lists forever.

Also, it's silly to even include that package list for any distro that does not 
use rpm/apt/pacman, since the list is just wasted lines. Instructions in doc file 
show what to change, and how, and has an example to make it clear. Odds of this  
actually being used? Not high, lol, but that's fine, if people want it done, they 
can do it, if not, nothing bad happens, it just won't show any suggested install
package, no big deal.

3. Using the new disk vendor method, added even more disk vendors. Thanks 
linux lite hardware database!!

4. EXCITING!! A new --admin/-a option, suggested by a user on techpatterns.com/forums/
Now -S or -b or -F with -a option for GNU/Linux shows the kernel boot parameters,
from /proc/cmdline. Didn't find anything comparable for BSDs, if you can tell me
where to look, I'll add it for those too, but wasn't anywhere I looked. Do the
BSDs even use that method? Don't know, but the logic is there, waiting to be used 
if someone shows me how to get it cleanly. The 'parameters:' item shows in the main
'System:' -S output, and will just show the entire kernel parameters used to boot.

This could be very helpful to distros who often have to determine if for example 
graphics blacklists are correctly applied for non free drivers, like nomodeset etc, 
or if the opposite is present. 

For forum/distro support, they just have to ask for: inxi -ba and they will see 
the relevant graphics info, for instance, or -SGaxxx, or -Faxxx, whatever is used
to trigger in this case the graphics and system lines.

5. Updated man/help for 4 as well, now explains what they will see with --admin/
-a options and -S. Good user suggestion, I wish all new features were this easy,
heh.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Weather explanations, disks, bugs!!

Bugs:
1. For sensors, in some cases, gpu failed to show correctly. This fixed issue #175

Fixes:
1. Made help/man explanations of weather changes more clear.
Particularly in regards to no automated query info. But also for supported 
location syntaxes.
2. Some corner cases of null weather data return null and tripped 
a null data error. This is corrected.
3. Added city duplicate filter to weather output, this hopefully will 
in some cases avoid printing city name twice, depends on weather source.
4. Removed --weather-source option 0, that no longer works so all code was 
removed.
5. More deb822 fixes, loosened up even more syntax. That's a poorly designed
config syntax, hard to work with.

Enhancements:
1. Lots of new disk vendors. So many!! Thanks linux-lite hardware database!
switched to a new method of getting disk name/vendor data, now it's a lot easier
to check for new ones.
2. Added fancybar to desktop info.

  * Shows precipitation, not rain/snow.
  * Adds Sunrise/sunset (most sources do not have this)

Version: 3.0.31
Patch: 00
Date: 2019-02-06
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. Big update! Get it in before your freeze!!

Bugs:
1. Maybe the vendor/product regex, which when + was used, would put out
errors.
2. Maybe Fix 4, since that could lead to incorrect behavior when sudo 
is involved depending on sudo configuration.
3. BIG: current inxi weather will probably fail if not updated to this or
newer versions!! Not an inxi bug per se, but your users will see it as one.

Fixes:
1. Fixed Patriot disk ID.
2. Fixes for PPC board handling. 
3. Regex cleaner fixes, this could lead to error in special cases of product
vendor names.
4. crazy from frugalware pointed out that $b_root detection was flawed, and
relied on a bad assumption, particularly for sudo. As usual, he's right, that
is now corrected, and uses $< Perl native to determine UID.

Enhancements:
1. Added septor to Debian system base.
2. Removed quiet filters for downloaders when using --dbg 1, now you see the 
entire download action for curl/wget downloads. This went along with 
issue # 174
3. New feature: --wan-ip-url. This closed issue #174. Also has user config 
option: WAN_IP_URL as well to make changes permanent.
4. Added --dbg 1 to man and help. The other --dbg options are random and can 
change, but --dbg 1 is always for downloading, so might as well tell people 
about it.
5. To anticipate the loss of a major weather API, inxi is redone to use smxi.org
based robust API. This also allows for a new switch, --weather-source (or --ws 
for shorter version), options 0-9, which will trigger different APIs on smxi.org.
Added WEATHER_SOURCE configuration option as well. Note that 4-9 are not 
currently active. Also added in better error handling for weather.
The main benefit here is that inxi is now largely agnostic to the weather APIs
used, and those can be changed with no impact to inxi users who are running 
frozen pool inxi's, or who have not updated their inxi versions.

NOTE: all inxi versions older than 3.0.31 will probably fail for weather 
quite soon. So update your inxi version in your repos!!
6. More disk vendors IDs and matches. Thanks linuxlite hardware database. 
7. Going along with weather changes, added, if present, cloud cover, rain, and
snow reports. Those are for previously observed hour.
8. Small change to Intel CPU architecture, taking a guess on stepping for 
skylake/Cascade lake ID. Guessing if stepping is > 4, it's cascade lake. But
could not find this documented, so it's a guess. At worst, it  means that Cascade
lake, which must be a later steppingi than 4, will not be ID'ed as skylake.
9. Documentation updates for data sources.

Changes:
1. inxi now uses a new system to get weather data. There is no longer a risk
of weather failing if the API used locally in inxi fails or goes away. This 
change should be largely invisible to casual users.
2. In weather, moved dewpoint to be after humidity, which makes a little more 
sense.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.30
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-12-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. 

Bugs:
1. Both a fix and a bug, in that inxi had an out of date list of Xorg drivers.
This led to all the newer Intel devices failing to show their drivers in the 
Xorg driver lines, like i915, i965, and so on. Updated to full current list of
Xorg drivers. This is not technically a bug since it's simply things that came 
into existence after that logic was last updated. But it looks like a bug.

Fixes:
1. Issues #170 and #168 showed a problem with inxi believing it was running in IRC 
when Ansible or MOTD started inxi. This is because they are not tty so trip the
non tty flag, which assumes it's in IRC in that case. The fix was to add a 
whitelist of known clients based on the parent name inxi discovers while running 
inside that parent. MOTD confirmed fixed, Ansible not confirmed. Why do people file 
issue reports then not follow up on them? Who knows.
Note that this issue is easy to trip by simply doing this: echo 'fred' | inxi 
which disables the tty test as well. To handle that scenario, that is, when inxi is 
not first in the pipe, I added many known terminal client names to the whitelists.
This works in my tests, though the set of possible terminals, or programs with 
embedded terminals, is quite large, but inxi handles most of them automatically. When
it doesn't, file an issue and I'll add your client ID to the whitelist, and use --tty
in the meantime.
2. Issue #171 by Vascom finally pinned down the wide character issue which manifests
in some character sets, like greek or russian utf8. The fix was more of a work-around
than a true fix, but inxi now simply checks the weather local time output for wide 
characters, and if detected, switches the local date/time format to iso standard, 
which does not contain non ascii characters as far as I can tell. This seemed to
fix the issue.
3. Added iso9660 from excluded file systems for partitions, not sure how inxi 
missed that one for so long.
4. See bug 1, expanded and made current supported intel drivers, and a few other 
drivers, so now inxi has all the supported xorg drivers again. Updated docs as well
to indicate where to get that data.

Enhancements:
1. As usual, more disk vendor/product ID matches, thanks to linuxlite hardware
database, which never stops providing new or previously unseen disk ids. Latest 
favorite? Swissarmy knife maker victorinox Swissflash usb device.
2. Added Elive system base ID.
3. Added Nutyx CARDS repo type.

Version: 3.0.29
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-12-10
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, fixes, updates, missing specs.

Bugs: 
1. See fix 4, incorrect positioning of Trinity desktop detection logic.

Fixes:
1. Vascom reports in issue #169 that some systems are making the /sys cpu 
vulnerability data root read only. Added <root required> test and output.
2. A while back, they added several chassis types in the smbios 
specifications. I used an older specification pdf file, this is now corrected. 
Note that realworld use of the new types exists, like tablet, mini pc, and so 
on. This missing data caused Machine report to list N/A as machine type when 
it was actually known. I'd been using an older specification PDF, and had 
failed to look at the actual spec download page, where you could clearly see
the newer spec file. Corrected this in the inxi docs as well.
3. Made gentoo repo reader check for case insensitive values for enabled. 
Also extended that to other repo readers that use similar syntax, they are 
all now case insensitive (Yes/yes/YES, that is)
4. Fixed incorrect handling of Trinity desktop ID, that needed to happen in 
the kde ID block, as first test, not after it. Caused failure in Q4OS trinity, 
and maybe others. I'm not sure why inxi had the detection where it was, it 
made no real sense, so that's now nicely integrated, so these types of 
failures should not happen again. Thanks Q4OS for exposing that issue.

Enhancements:
1. Added TDM and CDM display managers. Never seen either (Q4OS uses TDM), TDM 
corrected. CDM not confirmed, don't know if it's still around, but if it is 
similar to TDM re cdm.pid in /run, it should be detected fine.
2. Added more disk vendors/ids, the list never stops!! Thanks LinuxLite 
Hardware database, your users seem to use every disk known to humanity.
3. Added Debian derived Q4OS distro ID and system base handler.

-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Fixes, enhancements.

Bugs:
1. ARM fix, odroid > 1 cpu speeds not showing correctly. 
2. Ansible start fixes.
3. Fringe Battery failures, see Pinebook.

Fixes:
1. Removed null data message 'old system' since that's not always the case.
2. Added support for > 1 CPU speeds in systems with > 1 CPU.
3. Added is_numeric test for sudo version tests, that was tripping errors in
rare cases.
4. Fine tuned terminal size setting to check that is int to correct the 
Ansible problem.
5. ARM Pinebook fixes, battery, cpu. This also fixes corner cases where 
the battery charge state is missing but it is a systme battery.

Enhancments:
1. Added more disk ID matches/vendors. Thanks LinuxLite Hardware database!!
2. UKUI, ukwm, ukui-panel added to desktop data.
3. Added PopOS to system base.
4. Ansible/Chef user noted that inxi believes that it is running in IRC when 
started by Ansible / Chef (not sure about Chef but assuming it's the same).
Added flag --tty flag to force inxi to believe it's running in shell no matter 
what starts it. Note that this fix is not confirmed because the person didn't 
confirm the fix. Annoying.
5. Added Ubuntu disco to ubuntu_id.

Patch: 00
Date: 2018-10-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Fixes, stitches, and returns!!

Bugs:
1. As a fix (3), failure to handle spaces in mount source names. More of a fix than 
a bug, since it was an old issue #63.
2. OSX errors, BSD errors, but not really inxi errors or bugs, more weird data 
tripping null data or unreadable file errors, but I'll call those bugs since they 
look like bugs to end users. See Fixes for more.
3. See Fix 4, this is sort of a bug, inxi failed to return expected values on 
success/failure.

Fixes:
1. One of the documented config items, COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY had not been implemented
internally. This is now corrected.
2. Apple OSX was returning errors, those were fixed.
3. Finally handled ancient issue #63, support now there for spaces in remote source
name. This means that both spaces in source block name, and mount point name, are 
in theory both handled now. This was also to fix an osx issue #164 despite the 
fact that technically I do not support osx beyond fixing errors, but since in this 
case the issue was a long standing one, I fixed it for everything.
4. Big fix, I'd completely left undone proper unix type error number returns in
inxi, oops. Thanks Unit193 for noticing that and prompting me to fix it. Now inxi 
returns integer success/error numbers as expected.
5. OSX xml based version info broke, of course, naturally it would, so I added in
an osx fallback where if no distro version detected, use fallback unix method, which 
is what all the other unices use.
6. Along with space in source name, fixed mapped handling a bit more too for
partitions.
6. Added cifs remote file system to disk size used blacklist, and iso9660. Not sure 
how I'd missed those for so long.
7. OpenBSD vmstat in 6.3 changed the column order for avm/fre, and changed to a,
sigh, human readable default format, in M, so to handle this for all bsds, I had 
to make a dynamic column detection for avm and fre, and use those after, and also 
i had to add in a M detection, if found, *1024 and strip out M, sigh. 
8. OpenBSD, another alternate ordering/syntax issue, the dmesg.boot data for disks 
does not always use the same order in comma separated list, saw user case where 
the first item after : was the MB size, not the second. Made detection dynamic.
9. Due to Android case, found types where no cpu speed data was found, no max speed 
at least, which tripped an error due to null data for ARM, this is now handled, 
now cpu speed min/max read permissions in /sys are checked first before trying to 
read, and default failures are better handled.
10. On man page, added in clarification of the moving of Memory: item from Info:
line to ram Memory: line, explaining when it appears where. I am ambivalent about
removing the item from -I, I may revert that change, I find it non-intuitive to
move the Memory report around.

Enhancements:
1. Added display manager Ly, plus Ly version number. Thanks NamedKitten, this 
closes issues #166 #165 #162
2. Improved documentation a bit to avoid ambiguity re how to get colors in output.
That handles issue #161, thanks fugo for the nudge to improve the documentation.
3. First inxi on Android tests, using termux, which has a debian based apt 
type installer, got inxi running on at least two devices, including pixel2, but 
discovered that apparently as of android 5, /sys is now locked up in terms of 
wildcard reads, but further analysis is required, but as of now, inxi works in 
termux, but fails to get any Device data for A, G, or N. Thus it also fails to match 
IF to Device, so none of the IP data shows up. The latter will probably be fixed 
since Android has ip and ifconfig already, or termux does, but so far I found no 
way to get device data for ARM in Android 5.x and greater (checked on 
android 7 and 9 in real phones).
4. More disk vendors!! thanks linuxlite / linux hardware database for offering an 
apparently never ending list of obscure and not so obscure disk vendors and 
products.
5. While I was unable to get confirmation or documentation on file names for 
tce repo files, I guessed that localmirrors would be used, but this may be 
any random text file in /opt at all, no extensions, I'd have to test to confirm 
or deny possible values.
6. To handle more complex debugger failures, added --debug-no-proc, 
--debug-no-exit, to skip or enable completion where proc or sys debugger is hanging.

Changes:
1. Changed vendor in A, G, and N to -x, not -xxx, this data seems much more useful 
and reliable than I'd first expected when I made the feature, the -xxx was more 
an indication of my lack of trust in the method and source, but so far it seems 
pretty good, so I bumped it up to an -x option. Note that also, it's quite useful 
to know the vendor of, say, your network or graphics card, not just the actual 
device internal data, which is all inxi has ever shown previously.
2. Small change, if no partition type data is found, dev, remote, mapped, default
now says 'source:' instead of 'dev:' which makes more sense. Note that df calls
that column 'source', so I decided to go with their language for the default not  
found case. Also changed mapped to say mapped. This was part of a bit of a 
refactor of the partition type logic, enhanced by adding mapped to existing types,
and moved the entire type detection block into the main data generator, and out 
of the data line constructor.

Optimizations:
1. Tested, and dumped, List::Util first() as a possible way to speed up grep 
searches of arrays, where the goal is just to see if something is in an array. My
expectation was that first(), returning the first found instance of the search term,
would of course be faster since it will always exit the search loop was met with 
the sad fact that first() is about 2 to 4 times SLOWER than grep() native builtin.
I tested this fairly carefully, and used NYTProf optimizer tool and the results were 
totally consistent, first() was always much slower than grep(), no matter what size 
the array is. I assume this means the core C programming that makes grep is simply
much better than the File::Util module programming that makes first(). Removed 
first() and now know that nothing will be faster than grep so no need to look there
for speed improvements.
The moral of the story: just because something should in theory be faster, does 
sadly not mean it will be faster, for there are bigger things at work, skill of 
the programmers who made the logic, how perl handles external vs internal tools,
and so on. As an aside, this forms a fairly consistent pattern where I've found 
Perl by itself to be faster than modules in many cases, that is, it's faster to
write the code out than to use a module in many cases that I have tested, so I 
will always test such ideas and dump every one that is in fact slower than native 
Perl builtins.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.26
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-09-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man.

Bugs:
1. If you consider failure to identify a mounted yet hidden partition a bug, then 
that bug is fixed, but I consider that as more of a fix than a bug.

Fixes:
1. Added more device pattern ID for odroid C1 and C2, these are now pretty well 
supported.
2. inxi failed to handle a certain type of hidden partition, so far only seen 
with udiskctl mounted TimeShift partitions, but this may be a more general udisk 
issue, but so far not enough information. The fix is to use the lsblk data to 
build up missing partitions, so this fix is for non legacy Linux systems only.
The fix works pretty well, but it's hard to know until we get a lot more real
world data, but given so far I've received only one issue report on it, I 
suspect this is not a common situation, but you never know, it would never 
have shown up in datasets unless I had looked specifically for it, so it may 
be more common than I think.
3. Cleaned up and simplified new --admin -p and -d logic.
4. Refactored deb822 apt handling due to utter randomness of syntax allowed.

Enhancements:
1. For debugging, renamed all user debugger switches to have prefix --debug.
These options are to help debug debugger failures, and so far have been tested 
and solved the failures, so I'm adding them all to the main man and help menu, 
thus raising them to the level of supported tools. These were enormously helpful
in solving proc or sys debugger hangs.
 * --debug-proc
 * --debug-proc-print
 * --debug-no-sys
 * --debug-sys
 * --debug-sys-print
2. Added findmnt output to debugger, that may be useful in the future. Also added 
df -kTPa to also catch hidden partitions in debugger.
3. Added in another user level debugger, triggered with --debug-test-1 flag. This
will do whatever operation is needed at the time for that user. Some issues can 
only be resolved by the user on their machine.
4. More disk vendors and matches!!! Thanks linuxlite/linux hardware database!

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.25
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-09-24
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Huge set of changes. Excitement!! Thrills! Spills?

Bugs:
1. There was a missing main::is_int test that in some instances triggered 
error. This is corrected.
2. More of a fix, but legacy devices were not matching NIC to IF because 
the /sys path was not a link as it is now. I made a separate function to
handle that match test so it could be more readily worked with.

Fixes:
1. Arch/Manjaro presented yet another Xorg.wrapper path, this time /usr/lib. Why?
who knows. That to me is a bug, but since if it's not handled in inxi, it makes 
it look like inxi has a server: -G bug, I worked around it. Again. This creates 
the bug when you do not use the actual true path of Xorg where Xorg.wrapper 
complains and will not show -version data. Why move this? why use that wrapper
thing? I don't know, makes no sense to me.
2. More MIPS data, thanks manjaro ARM people. This made MIPS much better, though
it will certainly need more work.
3. Better ARM support, added in devicetree strings, which helps pad out the 
Devices IDs, albeit with very little data, but at least the devices are detected.
Thanks Manjaro ARM people there again.
4. Removed Upstart init test for arm/mips/sparc devices. This test made MIPS 
device totally puke and die, killed networking, so since very few upstart running
systems will be arm/mips devices, I decided there better safe than sorry.
5. Found another uptime syntax case, MIPS as root does not have the users item.
6. Many tweaks to SOC data generators, will catch more categories, but the lists 
will never be done since each device can be, and often is, random re the syntax.
SOC types are now filtered through a function to create consistent device type 
strings for the per device tool to use to assign each to its proper 
@device_<type> array.
7. USB networking failed to test usb type for 'network', which led to failed
ids on some device strings. 
8. For pciconf/FreeBSD, cleaned up device class strings to get rid of 0x and
trailing subsubclass values, this converts it into the same hex 4 item string
that is used by GNU/Linux/lspci so I can apply consistent rules to all pci 
types, no matter what the generator source is, lspci, pcidump, pciconf, and
eventually pcictl if I can get netbsd running.
9. Fixed internal --dbg counts for various features, and updated docs for that.
10. Fixed ARM / MIPS missing data messages, they were redundant.
11. Ongoing, moving excessive source comments to inxi-values.txt and inxi-data.txt.
12. Added unity-system-compositor as mir detection, who knew? I guess that was
its production application name all along? Oh well.

Enhancements:
1. Added basic support for OpenIndiana/Solaris/SunOS as a bsd type. Just enough
to make errors not happen.
2. Future proofed unix/bsd detections just to avoid the unset $bsd_type of non 
BSD unix.
3. Added S6 init system to init tool.
4. Added OpenBSD pcidump to new DeviceData feature. Includes now <root required>
message on Device-x: lines if not root. All working.
5. Fully refactored the old pci stuff to DeviceData package/class, due to adding
so many types to that, it made sense to make it a single class.
6. Did the same to USBData, because of lsusb, usbdevs, and /sys usb, made sense 
to integrate the data grabber into one package/class
7. Added speed: item to USB:, it shows in Mb/s or Gb/s
8. Added Odroid C1/C2 handling, which is one big reason I opted to refactor the 
devices data logic into DeviceData.
9. Added ash shell, not sure if that detection will work, but if it does, 
it will show.
10. As part of the overall DeviceData refactor, I moved all per type data into 
dedicated arrays, like @device_graphics, @device_audio, @device_network, etc, 
which lets me totally dump all the per device item tests, and just check the 
arrays, which have already been tested for on the construction of the primary
DeviceData set. Moved all per type detections into DeviceData so that is now 
one complete logic block, and the per type data generators don't need to know
about any of that logic at all anymore.
11. Added sway, swaybar, way-cooler as window managers, info items. Not 100% 
positive about the --version, their docs weren't very consistent, but I think
the guess should be right if their docs weren't incorrect.
12. Added vendor: item to network, not sure why I kept that off when I added 
vendor: to audio and graphics. It made sense at the time, but not now, so now 
-GNA all have vendor: if detected.
13. More device vendors!! The list never ends. Thanks linuxlite/linux hardware 
database, somehow you have users that manage to use every obscure usb/ssd/hdd 
known to humanity.
14. Big update to --admin, now has the following:
 A: partitions: shows 'raw size: ' of partition, this lets users see the amount 
 of file system overhead, along with the available size as usual.
 B: partitions: show percent of raw in size:
 C: partitions: show if root, block size of partition file system. Uses
 blockdev --getbsz <part>
 D: partition: swap: show swappiness and vfs cache pressure, with (default)
 or (default [default value]) added. This apparently can help debugging some 
 kernel issues etc. Whatever, I'll take someone's word for that.
 E: Disks: show block size: logical: physical: 
15. New option and configuration item: --partition-sort / PARTITION_SORT 
This lets users change default mount point sort order to any available ordering
in the partition item. Man page and help menu show options.
16. Going along with the MIPS fixes, added basic support for OpenWRT, which uses
an immensely stripped down busybox (no ps aux, for example), maybe because it
only runs as root user/ not sure, anyway, took many fixes.
17. Added Void Linux xbps repos to Repos section.

Changes:
1. Changed usb: 1.1 to rev: 1.1 because for linux, we have the USB revision number, 
like 3.1. Note that this is going to be wrong for BSDs, but that's fine.
2. Changed slightly the output of Memory item, now it follows the following rules:
 A: if -m/--memory is triggered (> -v4, or -m) Memory line always shows in Memory:
 item, which makes sense. Note that -m overrides all other options of where Memory
 minireport could be located.
 B: if -tm is triggered, and -I is not triggered, Memory shows in in -tm
 C: if -I is triggered, and -m is not triggered, Memory: shows in -I line.
 D: no change in short form inxi no arg output, Memory is there.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.24
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-09-10
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. Bug fix, enhancements, fixes.

Bugs:
1. Big bug found on certain systems, they use non system memory memory arrays, inxi
failed to anticipate that situation, and would exit with error when run as root for 
-m when it hit those array types. These arrays did not have modules listed, so the 
module array was undefined, which caused the failure. Thanks Manjaro anonymous 
debugger dataset 'loki' for finding this failure.
This is literally the first dataset I've seen that had this issue, but who knows 
how many other system boards will show something like that as well.

Fixes:
1. Related to bug 1, do not show the max module size item if not system memory 
and size is less than 10 MiB. Assuming there that it's one of these odd boards.

Enhancements:
1. For bug 1, extended Memory: report to include array type if not system memory.
That instance had Video Memory, Flash Memory, and Cache Memory arrays along with 
the regular System Memory array. Now shows: use: Video Memory for example if not 
System Memory to make it clear what is going on. 
2. Added basic Parrot system base, but for some inexplicable reason, Parrot changed 
the /etc/debian_version file to show 'stable' instead of the release number. Why?
Who knows, it would be so much easier if people making these derived distros would 
be consistent and not change things for no good reason. 
3. Added a few more pattern matches to existing vendors for disks. As usual, thanks 
linuxlite/linux hardware database for the endless lists of disk data.
4. Added internal dmidecode debugger switches, that makes it much easier to inject 
test dmidecode data from text files using debugger switches internally. 
5. Added -Cxx item, which will run if root and -C are used, now grabs L1 and L3 
cache data from dmidecode and shows it. I didn't realize that data was there, not 
sure how I'd missed it all these years, I guess pinxi really is much easier to work 
on! This only runs if user has dmidecode permissions from root or sudo.
6. Brought cpu architectures up to date, new intel, new amd. Note there's a slight 
confusion about what is coffee lake and what is kaby lake.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.23
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-09-07
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, man page. Fixes, enhancements, changes.

Thanks: 
1. AntiX forums, for testing -C --admin, suggestions, always helpful.

Bugs:
1. Added switch to set @ps_gui, I forgot case where info block was only thing 
that used ps_gui (Nitrux kde nomad latte case). This led to no info: data if 
other ps_gui switches not activated. Now each block that can use it activates it.

Fixes:
1. To clarify issue #161 added help/man explanation on how to get colors in cases 
where you want to preserve colors for piped or redirected output. Thanks fugo.
2. LMDE 3.0 released, slightly different system base handling, so refactored to 
add Debian version, see enhancement 2. Tested on some old vm instances, improved
old system Debian system base id, but it's empirical, distro by distro, there is
no rule I can use to automatically do it, sadly.
3. 'Motherboard' sensors field name added, a few small tweaks to sensors. This
was in response to issue #159, which also raised a problem I was not really 
aware of, user generated sensor config files, that can have totally random 
field names. Longer term solution, start getting data from sys to pad out 
lm-sensors data, or to handle cases where no lm-sensors installed. 
4. Fixed kwin_11 and kwin_wayland compositor print names, I'd left out the _,
which made it look strange, like there were two compositors or something.
5. Fixed latte-dock ID, I thought the program name when running was latte, not 
latte-dock. inxi checks for both now. Thanks Nitrux for exposing that in vm test.
6. Sensors: added in a small filter to motherboard temp, avoid values that are
too high, like SYSTIN: 118 C, filters out to only use < 90 C. Very unlikely a 
mobo would be more than 90C unless it's a mistake or about to melt. This may
correct anoymous debugger dataset report from rakasunka.

Enhancements:
1. Added --admin to -v 8 and to --debugger 2x
2. Added -a to trigger --admin. This lets you run something like -Fxxxaz
3. Expanded system base to use Debian version tool, like the ubuntu one, that 
lets me match version number to codename. The ubuntu one matches code names to
release dates. Added Neptune, PureOS, Sparky, Tails, to new Debian system base
handler.
4. Big enhancement: --admin -C now shows a nice report on cpu vulnerabilities, 
and has a good error message if no data found. Report shows:
Vulnerabilities: Type: [e.g. meltdown] status/mitigation: text explanation. 
Note: 'status' is for when no mitigation, either not applicable,  or is vulnerable.
'mitigation' is when it's handled, and how. Thanks issue #160 Vascom from Fedora 
for that request.
5. The never-ending saga of disk vendor IDs continues. More obscure vendors,
more matches to existing vendors. Thanks linuxlite/linux hardware database

Changes:
1. Reordered usb output, I don't know why I had Hubs and Devices use different 
ordering and different -x switch priorities, that was silly, and made it hard to
read.
Now shows: 
Device/Hub: bus-id-port-id[.port-id]:device-id info: [product info] 
type/ports: [devices/hubs] usb: [type, speed]
-x adds drivers for devices, and usb: speed is now default for devices, same as 
Hubs. Why I had those different is beyond me.
The USB ordering is now more sensible, the various components of each 
matching whether hub or device.

Unfixable or Won't Fix:
1. Unable to detect Nomad desktop. As far as I can tell, Nomad is only a theme 
applied to KDE Plasma, there is no program by that name detectable, only a 
reference in ps aux to a theme called nomad. 
2. Nitrux system base ID will not work until they correct their /etc/os-release file.
3. Tails live cd for some inexplicable reason uses non standard /etc/os-release 
field names, which forces me to either do a custom detection just for them, or for
them to fix this bug. I opted for ignoring it, if I let each distro break standard 
formats then try to work around it, the distro ID will grow to be a 1000 lines long
easily. Will file distro bug reports when I find these from now on.

Version: 3.0.22
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-08-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, man page. Bug fixes, enhancements.

Bugs:
1. A long standing bug was finally identified and fixed. -n/-i would fail to match 
a Device to the right IF in cases where they had the same chip / vendor IDs. Added 
busID for non Soc type devices to fix that. I hope. This fix has been tested on a
machine that had this bug, and it is now corrected. Thanks skynet for the dataset.
2. deepin-wm was failing to get listed correctly with new fixes, this is corrected.

Fixes:
1. mate version was depending on two tools, mate-about and mate-session, which 
somewhat randomly vary in which has the actual highest version number. Fix was to 
run both in MATE for version, and run those through a new version compare tool.
Thanks mint/gm10 for reporting that bug.
2. -Gxx compositors: added some missing ones that were being checked for in-
correctly.
3. For distro id, fixed a glitch in the parser for files, now correctly removes
empty () with or without spaces in it.
4. Got rid of ' SOC?' part of no data for ram or slots, that also triggers in non 
SOC cases, so best to not guess if I can't get it right.

Enhancements:
1. More disk vendor ID matches, also, somehow missed QEMU as vendor, thanks to
linux hardware database (linuxlite) for great samples of vendor/product strings.
2. Added a bunch of compositors, found a new source that listed a lot inxi did not 
have already. 
3. Added version v: for some compositors in -Gxxx.
4. New program_data() tool provides an easier to use simple program version/print 
name generator, including extra level tests, to get rid of some code that repeats.
5. Found some useful QEMU virtual machines for ARM, MIPS, PPC, and SPARC, so 
made initial debugging for each type, so basic working error free support is well
on its way for all 4 architectures, which was unexpected. More fine tunings to 
all of them to avoid bugs, and to catch more devices, as well.
Note that QEMU images are hard to make, and they were not complete in terms of 
what you would see on physical hardware, so I don't know what features will work 
or not work, there may be further variants in audio/network/graphics IDs that
remain unhandled, new datasets always welcome for such platforms!
6. Found yet another desktop! Added Manokwari support, which is at this point 
a reworking of gnome, but it was identifiable, minus a version number.
7. Added deepin and blankon to system base supported list, these hide their debian
roots, so I had to use the manual method to provide system base.
8. Extended -Sxxx info: item to include system trays, and a few more bars and
panels. So this product now shows bars, panels, trays, and docks. And that's I
think good enough, since those are the basic tools most desktop/wm's will use.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.21
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-08-17
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, man page. Big set of changes. Full USB refactor, plus added features.

Bugs:
1. A result of the issue #156 USB refactor, I discovered that the --usb sort order,
which was based on Bus+DeviceID, in fact is wrong, pure and simple. This was exposed 
by using a second USB hub on a bus, the Device IDs are not really related in any 
clearly logical way to the actual position on the bus. The solution was to fully
refactor the entire USB logic and then use generated alpha sorters based on the full 
bus-port[.port] ID. Device ID is now printed last in the ID string, like so: 1-4:1. 
Note that Device IDs start at 1 for each bus, regardless of how many hubs you have
attached to that port.
2. Certain situations triggered a bug in Optical devices, I'd forgotten to change
$_ to $key in two places. Since that part didn't normally get triggered, I'd never
noticed that bug before. Thanks TinyCore for exposing that glitch!

Fixes:
1. On legacy systems, fluxbox --version does not work, -v does. Corrected.
2. for --usb, network devices should now show the correct 'type: Network'.
For some weird reason, the people who made the usb types didn't seem to consider
many key devices, scanners, wifi/ethernet adapters, and those are almost always 
"Vendor defined class".
3. A really big fix, for instances where system is using only Busybox, like 
TinyCore, or booting into any system running busybox for whatever reason, now 
avoids the various errors when using busybox ps, which only for example outputs
3, not 11, default columns for ps aux, and which does not support ps -j, which
is used in the start/shell client information. This gets rid of a huge spray 
of errors, and actually allows for pretty complete output from systems that only
have busybox tools installed. This should cover everything from TinyCore to MIPS 
to ARM systems that run minimalist Linux. Note that this fix goes along with the
/sys based USB parser, since such systems may have USB, but are unlikely to have 
lsusb installed, but do have /sys USB data.
4. In some cases, strings /sbin/init would trigger a false version result, fixed
that logic so now it rarely will do that.

Enhancements:
1. Added Moksha desktop, that's a Bodhi fork of Enlightenment E17; added qtile 
window manager (no version info).
2. Added Bodhi detection; Salix + base slackware; kde neon system base;
3. Added support for slaptget repos, basic, it may not be perfecct.
4. More disk vendors, and matches for existing vendors.
5. Full rewrite of USB data, in --usb, -A, and -N, along with core usb data engines.
This makes lsusb optional, though recommended (because it has a better vendor/
product ID to string internal database than /sys data). This was in response 
to a second set of issues in #156 by gm10, USB drivers.
Depending on the system, using only /sys data, while slightly less informative,
is between 20 and 2000 milliseconds faster, so if you want speed, either use the 
new --usb-sys option, or the configuration file USB_SYS=[true|false] option.
 1. switched to cleaner more efficient data structures
 2. added ports count to hub report, linux and bsd.
 3. added [--usb|-A|-N] -xxx serial for Device items, if present.
 4. added --usb -xx drivers, per interface, can be 1 or more drivers. 
 5. fully refactored -A and -N usb device logic, far cleaner and simple now,
 much easier to work with, no more hacks to find things and match them.
 6. USB type: now comes from /sys, and is in general going to be more accurate
 than the lsusb -v based method, which was always an ugly and incomplete hack.
 As with drivers, it also now lists all the interface types found per device, not
 just the first one as with the previous method. Note that HID means the more 
 verbose: Human Interface Device, but I shortened it. Now that the type: data is 
 created by inxi reading the class/subclass/protocal IDs, and then figuring out
 what to do itself, I can have quite a bit more flexibility in terms of how type 
 is generated.
 7. added --usb -xxx interfaces: [count] for devices, which lists the device 
 interface count. This can be useful to determine if say, a usb/keyboard adapter 
 is a 2 interface device. Note that Audio devices generally have many interfaces, 
 since they do more than 1 thing (audio output, microphone input, etc.).
 8. Support for user configuration file item: USB_SYS=[true|false]. This is useful
 if you want to see only the /sys version of the data, or if you want the significant
 speed boost not using lsusb offers, particularly on older systems with a complex 
 USB setup, many buses, many devices, etc. 
 New option --usb-tool overrides USB_SYS value, and forces lsusb use.
 9. New options: --usb-sys - forces all usb items to use /sys data, and skip lsusb.
 Note that you still have to use the feature options, like --usb, -A, or -N. This
 can lead to a significant improvement in execution time for inxi.
 10. Rather than the previous bus:device ID string, to go along with the internal 
 sorting strings used, inxi now shows the real Bus / port /port ids, like:
 1-3.2.1:3 - Bus-Port[.port]:device id.
6. Added support for Xvesa display server. Thanks for exposing that one, TinyCore! 
7. Added tce package manager to repos. That's the tinycore package manager.

Changes:
1. big one, after 10 plus years, the venerable 'Card-x:' for -A,-N, and -G has been
replaced by the more neutral 'Device-x:'.  This was a suggestion by gm10 from Mint
in issue #156 
This makes sense because for a long time, most of these devices are not cards, they
are SOC, motherboard builtin, USB devices, etc, so the one thing they all are is 
some form of a device, and the one thing that they are all not is a Card. Along with
the recent change from HDD: to Local Storage in Disks: this brings inxi terminology
out of the ancient times and into the present. Thanks for the nudge gm10.

Removed:
See inxi-perl/docs/inxi-fragments.txt for removed blocks.
1. Entire parser for lsusb -v, now it all runs either usbdevs or lsusb, and if Linux 
and not lsusb, it will use /sys exclusively, otherwise it uses /sys data to complete 
the lsusb vendor/product strings.
2. Two functions that were used by -A and -N to match usb devices and get their /sys data,
that became redundant since it all now goes through the /sys parser already, so those
features can get the data pre-parsed from the @usb arrays.

Output Examples:

Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-30
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. ARM enhancements and updates, -S data ongoing enhancements.

Fixes:
1. Added support for new ARM SOC types, including chromebook ARM. Note that so far I
have been unable to find a way to detect MMC networking, at least in a meaningful
way. I know where the data is, but I can't figure out how to reasonably integrate it
into the main ARM soc/device generator logic because it's fundamentally different 
from most platform or devicetree data.
2. Added alternate battery tests, this should cover a wide range of alternate 
battery IDs, while still preserving the distinction between system power batteries,
and device batteries. The detection is now far more dynamic, and can handle 
unknown syntax for battery ID, while not losing the ability to correctly identify
device batteries (like mice, keyboards, etc).
3. Trying a somewhat unreliable hack to get cpu variant for arm devices where the
current method fails. this may be removed if it causes false ID in the future.
4. Excluded all /driver/ paths from ARM SOC @pci generation, those give read errors
even as root.
5. Fixed a few defective wm version detections.

Enhancements:
The -S line continues to see many improvements.
1. Greatly expanded the set of info: items, now it covers all the toolbars, 
panels, and docks that I could find, plus a few things like icewmtray, where the 
wm has a built in panel. While there are probably more bar/panel/dock tools out 
there, and more will get added if or when they are encountered, now info: shows 
far more variants than ever before, and covers the range of options simpler wm 
users have for bars, trays, and panels. If I missed one that is detectable, by 
all means show how to detect it!
2. Fine tuned and added a few more window managers, and added version for some that 
were not showing versions.
3. Added 3 more dm version handlers, slim, gdm, gdm3, and refactored that code to 
use the same program_values/program_version logic that the other tools use.
4. A few more obscure and usb stick vendor IDs added.

Version: 3.0.19
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-23
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Fixes, glitches, and stitches!

Fixed some subtle and not subtle issues that I've noticed recently.

Bugs:
1. The color scheme selector failed to remove the global value when a non global
setting was used. This led to global values never getting removed, even though
the text output said it would be, which is confusing, obviously, and always 
overriding the color selected. Thanks CentOS for helping find that one.

Fixes:
1. Fixed possible corrupted user inxi.conf values. Now skips null values, and 
fully validates as integer integer values.
2. Fixed fvwm-crystal detections, integrated it into new refactored desktop logic.
3. For systems without glxinfo or running inxi out of gui/desktop, Xorg was in many 
cases failing to show version, which made it not show anything for server: except 
N/A. This is caused by a relatively recent change in behaviors in xorg, where you 
have to run it directly from it's true path, which is something like /usr/lib/xorg
or /usr/lib/server-xorg at which point the error:
/usr/lib/xorg-server/Xorg.wrap: Only console users are allowed to run the X server
Figuring this out was tricky, and who the heck knows why Xorg -version would even
return such a silly error in the first place, but there you have it. Next time 
you wonder why inxi is so long, this is why, endless churn in basic and complex 
things! The fix is injecting the optional xorg paths into @paths right before,
and removing them right after, which avoids adding clutter to the @paths.
4. A ZFS fix, I'd noticed this one a while back, but after looking at the zfs 
Ubuntu tutorial page, I realized that this is the norm now, which is building zfs
with /dev/sda (no partitions). This lead to failing to detect the zfs components,
and reporting a bunch of partitions as unmounted which were part of that /dev/sdb 
type component array. By allowing /dev/sd[a-z] I fixed both errors at the same time,
but I don't know if this syntax extends to say, nvme zfs as well. Note that when 
you build zfs arrays with say, /dev/sdb /dev/sdc you'll see two partitions per 
disk, /dev/sdx1 which is the main data, and /dev/sdx2, which is a tiny 8mB partition,
no idea what it's for. 
5. Fixed missing konversation and hexchat version numbers in -I, finally found 
what was going on there. Note that hexchat --version used to pop up a gui, but 
I guess he finally fixed that, I am hoping.
6. Fixed some gentoo repo detections, but also found more variants. Not sure what
exactly is going on with repos there, will wait for gentoo user issue reports to
really lock those down.
7. BSD fixes, turns out FreeBSD uses that same map ... syntax in df -kT as OSX...
Also made sure to load sysctl data for -S row, I'd forgotten about the compiler 
test there which needs that data.
8. Fixed herbstluftwm version detection, turns out it's another one of those that
passes the entire path to the version program, so it shows: /sbin/herbsuftwm 0.22.0
which broke the regex, easy fix.
9. Completed refactoring of DesktopData, now it's all data array driven for most 
wm, desktops, etc, which makes adding/removing one very easy. All core data is now 
in program_values to allow for automated detections.

Enhancements:
1. With fix 1, added check_int and check_number utilities, these validate that inxi 
internal numeric or integer values actually are what they are supposed to be. This 
uses a neat Perl trick that makse the checks super fast and super accurate. Moved
all internal int/numeric test regex to use these.
2. Added file based version number detection, that was done for Deepin, which uses
/etc/deepin-version for its version number, but it can be used for anything.
3. Added Deepin and deepin window managers, Lumina, added bspwm wm, fixed muffin 
detections. Note that lumina has a weird behavior where when run outside of pinxi,
it outputs to stdout, but inside of pinxi, to stderr, who the heck knows how that
happens! 
4. Added zorin to supported base: distros. 
5. Even more disk vendors added! The list of no-name off brand chinese ssd vendors
appears to be endless! Added some more specific ids to capture unique strings 
that can be linked to a vendor.
6. Added /usr/home to default -P paths, that's used instead of /home in the real
world, so why not show it?
7. Because qt detection is possible, I've extended qt toolkit detection, but it's
also not super accurate, but it's far better than gtk tk was, so I'm leaving
that in. I also extended it to more wm/desktops since more are using qt now.
Note: budgie 11 is going to be qt, but there's no way to distinguish between 11 and
gtk 10 without doing a bunch of hacks so I'm leaving that alone.
8. Found a possible distro id source, added /etc/calamares detections to debugger,
I'll see if that shows some consistent patterns before I implement a last fallback
test for distro IDs. It may work.

Removed:
1. Giving up on fake/slow/inaccurate GTK toolkit detections, removed the entire 
codeblock and stored in docs/inxi-fragments.txt, but I'm not going to do package 
manager type version tests anymore, if we can't get the data directly from a program
or file, it's not going to happen, plus the gtk installed on the system means nothing
in relation to the gtk version used to build the desktop.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.18
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Fixes, a few changes, enhancements.

Fixes:
1. Removed /dev/zram type data from swap partitions, since that's ram, it's
not a partition, obviously.
2. More alternate IPMI syntax found, that's clearly going to take a while to have 
most syntaxes handled.
3. Small lm-sensors adjustment, fringe cases might scramble up hwmon and gpu 
temps, this is now handled.

Enhancements:
1. Added disk vendors, udinfo.
2. Exciting! New Architecture: MIPS! First datasets, confirmed working. This led to
more abstracting of the previously ARM specific logic to be for SOC in general.
3. Related to 2, added in fallback busybox cases for partition data without fs.
4. Added window managers, xmonad, ratpoison, 9dm, gala (for Pantheon), notion,
windowlab
5. Added Pantheon desktop detection. Note, unable to find a way to get version 
number.
6. IMPI sensors: added in psu fans, dimm temp.
7. New -Cxxx option: cpu boost (aka turbo), state enabled / disabled, only shows 
if system has that option.

Changes:
1. Made toolkit for -S be -xx instead of -x, only Trinity/KDE and XFCE have that 
data.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.17
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Changes, bug fixes, enhancements! Don't delay!

Bugs:
1. A real bug, the detection for true path of /dev/root had a mistake in it and 
would only have worked in half the cases. This was an easy fix, but a significant 
one since it also would lead to the actual root / partition showing in Unmounted.
2. Related to the item Fixes-2, if two USB networking devices  were attached,
the second one's bus and chip ID would go on the wrong line of data if -n or -i
option were used. Since that would be the line belonging to the previous device,
that obviously was weird and wrong.
3. NEW: latest kernel can show hwmon data in sensors, for example from wifi chip.
This broke CPU temp detection and showed way too high cpu temp, so this fix is 
fairly important since new kernels may have this new sensors hwmon syntax.
4. Sensors: IPMI alternate syntax found, also case with no data in expected columns,
just N/A, so now the ipmi sensor logic skips all lines with non numeric values in 
the values column. This is what it should have done all along, it was trusting
that values would always exist for the field names it looks for.

Fixes:
1. ARM networking fix. ARM devices like rasberry pi that use usb bus for networking 
showed the no data message even though usb networking was right below it. This is 
corrected, and now that only shows if both main and usb networking failed for ARM.
2. Big repo fix: while testing distro and Trinity live cds, I discovered that apt is 
sometimes used with rpms, which made PCLinuxOS and ALT-Linux Repos item show the 
apt files but no data since the pattern was looking for start with deb. Added rpm 
to pattern, so all distros that use apt running rpms should now 'just work'.
3. Fixed more distro id things, PCLinuxOS should now show its full distro string.
4. Debugger: Filtered out more blocks of /proc, that data is bloated and messy, found
another case where it collected a vast amount of junk system data from zfs in that
case, just blocked the entire range. I had no idea /proc had so much junk data in it!
5. As noted above, IPMI, yet another alternate syntax for field names. My hope that
IPMI software and sensors will be more logical and consistent than lm-sensors output
is proving to be merely wishful thinking, I think now out of 3 datasets I've gotten,
I've seen 3 variants for syntax, not to mention the ipmi-tool vs ipmi-sensors 
differences. So IPMI will be like all sensors stuff, a work in progress, to 
be updated with every newly discovered alternate syntax and data set.

Enhancements:
1. Disk vendors, added some, improved pattern detections for others. This feature 
is getting better all the time. Thanks linuxlite hw db, easy to scan for missing 
vendors in their inxi data.
2. Added more wm, budgie-wm, mwm, variants of kwin and Trinity's Twin, several others, 
more refactoring of core wm/desktop code. 
3. Added gpu ram and reworked memory logic for rasberry pi, which is the only SBC 
I am aware of that uses that tool. Now reports the actual total, and also gpu: for 
ram data, so you can tell that the gpu is using part of the total. Again, this comes
from issue #153. Also added that info to man page for -I part.
4. Added more ARM and PCI cleaners for neater and more concise ARM/PCI output.
5. Added Trinity support to Desktop section, this had at least two different detection 
methods, but since the first just shows KDE original data, only the second one proved 
to be Trinity specific. Happily, the full data is available, toolkit, desktop version,
and wm (Twin).
6. New -G,-A,-R -xxx feature: vendor:. Note that vendor data is very bloated and 
messy so it's trimmed down substantially, using a series of filters and rules, and 
thus it can contain the following: the actual vendor, like Dell, nothing, the 
motherboard vendor/product for board based PCI items, or a complete vendor/product 
string if it's unique. I couldn't think of a clean field name that meant: 
vendor OR vendor + basic product info OR motherboard + board version OR full 
product name, including vendor, so in the end, I just used vendor: but it's not 
quite the right term, but nothing else seemed to work better. Testers responded 
very enthusiastically about this feature so I guess the vendor: feature is ok.

Changes:
1. Biggest change: Drives: HDD: total: the HDD: is now changed to: Local Storage: 
This was part of issue #153 and is a good suggestion because HDD generally was used to
refer to hard disks, spinning, but with nvme, m.2, ssd, mmc, etc, that term is a bit 
dated. 'Local' is because inxi does not include detected remote storage in the totals.
2. The recent --wm option which forced ps as data source for window manager detection
has been reversed, now --wm forces wmctrl and ps aux is preferred. Still falls back 
to wmctrl in case the ps test is null, this is better because I have to add the wm
data manually for each one, whereas wmctrl has an unknown set and probably variable 
set of wm. Note that I reversed this because I saw several cases where wmctrl was 
wrong, and reported a generic source wm instead of the real one. Since most users are 
not going to even be aware of the wm: feature as enhanced with --wm switch, this 
should have no impact on users in general. Since the detected wm name needs to be
known and handled to get assigned to wm: and wm version data, I think it will work 
better to have the known variants match with the wm data values, then just fallback to 
unknown ones that can get filled in over time as we find wm that people actually 
use and that you can get version info on and detect.
3. Moved help menu debugging options to bottom of help, which makes the option set 
more logical as you go down the list:
Output Control Options:
Additional Options:
Advanced Options:
Debugging Options:

Removed:
1. Got rid of tests for GTK compiled with version for many desktops, that test 
was always wrong because it did not have any necessary relation to the actual 
gtk version the desktop was built out of, and it also almost always returned no 
data. Since this is an expensive and slow test, and is always going to be wrong 
or empty anyway, I've removed it. My tests showed it taking about 300ms or so
to generate no data, heh. That's the tk: feature in -S. 
Note I also found that gnome-shell takes an absurdly long time to give --version 
info, the slowest of all such things, 300ms again, just to show version? Someone 
should fix that, there's no possible reason why it should take 300 milliseconds 
to give a simple version string. Note that this returns tk: to only returning 
real data, which in this case means only xfce, kde, and trinity, which are the 
only desktops that actually report their toolkit data. I'll probably remove 
that code in the future unless I can think of some real use for gtk version 
elsewhere, but it's just junk data which doesn't even work.

In the future, I will not try to emulate or guess at desktop toolkits, either they
show the data in a direct form like XFCE or Trinity or KDE do, or I won't waste
resources and execution time making bad guesses using inefficient code and logic.
QT desktops like LXQt I'm leaving in because I believe those will tend to track 
more closely the QT version on the system, and the tests for QT version aren't
huge ugly hacks the way they are for GTK, so they aren't as slow or intrusive, but
those may also get removed since they almost never work either. But they are also
slowing down the -Sx process so maybe they should be removed as well, I'll think 
about it. Since they only are used on LXQt and razer-qt, it probably isn't a big 
deal overall.

Version: 3.0.16
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-08
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Several bug fixes, enhancements, options.

Bugs:
1. In some cases, -S Desktop showed xfce when it wasn't xfce. This should be largely
corrected now.
2. Big bug: using lxqt-about for lxqt --version, now opens a dialog box, gui, 
so removed that, and now checking lxqt-session for version info instead.

Fixes:
1. Now calling hitachi hgst drives vendor: HGST (Hitachi) to differentiate between 
regular Hitachi and HGST hitachi. Added a few more disk vendors.
2. Distro base and core: added linuxlite, elementary. Some distros use:
/etc/upstream-release/lsb-release so testing for that and os-release now too.
3. Extended qt detections, may catch a few stray ones now in non kde qt 
desktops.
4. Complete refactor of desktop, desktop info, wm, and -G compositor, now much 
easier to extend each feature and add detections, move order around, etc.
Also moved wm to -Sxx now that I use fallback ps aux tests, which were themselves 
also totally refactored and optimized. Fixed WindowMaker id, which is made more 
annoying because they are the only upper/lower case program name, but in at least 
debian, the actual program name is wmaker internally. 
Also tightened in particular gnome-shell, which was failing to show due to too
restrictive filtering of desktop/vm repeats. Most wm do not contain the desktop 
name in the string, gnome-shell does, only one I'm aware of.
5. Removed N/A from wmctrl output, which just means null, which is what we want.
6. Removed gnome-shell from info: since it will now appear in wm: if found. Added 
a few -panel items to info:

Enhancements:
1. Showing type: network bridge for -N when it's type 0680, which is an odd pci 
type, generally it's a network bridge, but I figured it's best to show that 
explicitly to avoid confusion. This extends the 'type:' from just USB.
2. Added more window managers to wm, matchbox, flwm, fvwm2 (used to just use fvwm,
this was wrong, it's its own thing), a few others.
3. Added a few more compositors to -Gxx. kwin_x11 should be the most noticeable, 
but added some more obscure ones too. This feature requires more work.
4. Extended ARM syntax to support a new one, path to /sys/device... has an extra 
/soc/ in it, that is now handled, all are tested for. Confirmed working. Note that 
ARM has to be confirmed fixed on a device by device basis, since there are key 
syntax differences in the paths, but it will get easier the more variants that are 
discovered. Added another trimmer to cut off \x00|01|02|03 special non printing 
characters which show as weird jibbberish in output, for model/serial number.
5. Refactored wm, info, desktop, compositor, now all use @ps_gui, which is all that 
is tested against, not the entire ps_cmd array. This drops the possible tests down 
massively since the only things in ps_gui will be the actual stuff found that matches 
all the patterns required for that system, not all ps items. Added marco, muffin 
fixes. Was showing wm: Metacity (Marco) that is not correct, now shows marco, which
then allows to get version too. 
5. -Sxxx now shows wm: version as well, which can be of use now and then.
6. --wm added to trip force using of ps data for wm, this can be useful because 
I don't know all variants of wmctrl output, so that makes it easier to test.
7. Added finally support for --debug 3, which now shows timers, functions, and args
printed to screen.
8. Added qmake --version to fallback qt detection.

Version: 3.0.15
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-07-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Big bug fix, new features.

Bugs:
1. Finally tracked down and solved the Xorg drivers bug which was caused by 
Xorg checking its list of defaults 2 times, not 1, which resulted in failed 
status on second try since it was already loaded. Secondary bug was found that
resulted in failing to show the failed, and only showing unloaded, which was also
wrong. This finally fixes issue #134 item 5. Thanks Mint users for the help on 
that one.
2. Small bug in Openbox version detection, typo.
3. fixed a small glitch in the dm: detection that on systems where /var/run 
exists but is not linked to /run, the dm would fail to get detected.

Fixes:
1. Xfce when defaulting to no version found goes to 4, this is a bad idea, it's
better to not show any version, since xfce could one day be 5.
2. Fixed Blackbox fallback detection, there were cases where Blackbox not found 
in xprop -root, now it falls back to ps aux detection.
3. For wm: tested all known variants, added support for things like Mutter (Marco) 
syntax. Note that bunsenlab uses XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=XFCE to work around some
glitches, but it's actually Openbox. If run as root, it will show openbox correctly,
otherwise -Sxxx will show wm: openbox, but that's due to bunsenlabs choices there.
4. Rewrote a lot of DistroData to handle more dynamic testing of values, it's sad
that at almost 2020 we are still stumbling around trying to find a consistent way
to identify distros, and derived distros.
5. Added more debugger data collectors in the logging, some data was not
being tracked well during log process which made debugging harder.

Enhancements:
1. New feature, -Gxx now shows for Xorg drivers alternate: which are drivers that
Xorg auto checks but which are not installed. Those were ignored in the past. This
can be useful to see for example that there are other driver install options 
available. Thanks gm10 for that suggestion.
2. Tested and added the following explicit handlers for Distros: and base: in 
some cases:
grml, peppermint, kali, siduction, aptosid, arco, manjaro, chakra, antergos, 
bunsenlabs, and a few others. These are a pain to add and test, basically I have
to boot a live cd of each one, then test the files and ID methods, but the ID 
methods must also be as dynamic as possible because you never know when a distro 
is going to change how they use os-release vs issue vs lsb-release vs <name>-release.
I would have tested a few more but their livecds failed to properly run on vbox.
3. Added a few more disk vendor IDs.
4. Added some more programs to debugger data collector for future feature vdpau, but
that needs more data because we don't really know the variants for example for 
dual card systems.
5. Man page: changed extra options to use only one option name per list of options
for that feature, each separate item is started as a new paragraph with -
This makes it a bit more consistent and maybe slightly easier to read the man. 
Added -Gxx item, updated -Sx item.

Version: 3.0.14
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-06-27
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Tiny bug fix, Ubuntu based distros only.

The 3.0.13 system base feature had a small bug in the logic that was supposed to
get the version id from codename, the bug made it never work. This is only relevant 
for Ubuntu based distros, so if you are on some other base like Debian or Arch, you
can ignore this one, 3.0.13 will work fine.

No other changes, this was mainly for Mint, and other Ubuntu derived distros in 
the future.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.13
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-06-23
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, man page. New features and fixes!

Bugs:
1. -I line, sometimes running in showed sudo. This is hopefully now corrected.

Fixes:
1. CPU architectures, small reordering based on hopefully more reliable data 
source, but these are hard to find conclusively.
2. -S Distro id: switched ordering of prefered os-release sources, PRETTY_NAME 
is not being used consistently, too many distros leave out the distro id found 
in VERSION, so now it uses NAME + VERSION if both are there, then PRETTY_NAME
as a fallback. That reverses how it was, but it will provide better results for
most distros. Distros that did this properly to begin with should see no change.
3. Now that inxi is basically debugged and working, I've removed the output of
'inxi' from the -t lines. It remains for the pinxi branch however so you can 
see how many resources pinxi uses to run.
4. ipmi sensors data are proving to be as random as lm-sensors. Added another 
alternate syntax for sensors.
5. CPU: found an alternate syntax, again, for IPMI and sensors data, added 
support, I hope, for that.

Enhancements:
1. Added /proc debugger tool to debugger. Due to oddities with how the /proc file 
system is created, it will only run as user, not root, unless the --proc flag is 
used. More programs added to debugger commands.
2. More disk vendor strings added, fine tuning of vendor detections. There is a 
tendency in NVMe disk names to put the vendor name in the middle of the string. 
That is now handled for a few key vendors.
3. Added basic ARM SOC and server support. This will require more work in the future
because the syntax used varies significantly device to device, but the featuers 
are now in place to add that support. Most SBC ARM devices should now at least show
the model and details data in machine data, and some will show -G -A -N data as 
well.
4. ARM CPU: added first attempt to show the cpu variant as well as the more 
generic ARM data. This shows 1 or more variants, some ARM devices have two different 
cpu cores running at different speeds. Odroid for example.
5. Added system 'base:' data for -Sx, that modifies Distro: in supported cases.
Currently only Mint and MX/AntiX supported because each specific distro must be 
handled explicitly using empirical file based data tests. I decided against showing
this for rolling release, since really everyone knows that Antergos is made from 
Arch Linux, so showing that does not provide much useful information, whereas 
showing the Ubuntu version Mint was made from does.

Note that several derived distros are changing how they use os-release, so the 
tools had to be revised to be more dynamic, which is a pain, and makes it even
more empirical and less predictable to print what should be trivially easy to
gather distro and derived source data.

If your distro is not in this list and you want the base data to be present, please
supply a --debug 22 dataset so I can check all the files required to make the 
detection work. If your distro has changed methods, please note which methods 
were used in the past, and which are used now.
6. Added Armbian distro detection, that's tricky. Added Rasbpian detections. 
Added improved Antergos, Arco, and maybe Chakra, Arch detections.
7. Big one: Hardware RAID basic support added. Note that each vendor, and 
unfortunatley, often each product line, has its own raid status and drive
reporting tools, which makes adding the actual drive/raid/status report part 
very time consuming to add. I may only support this if a certain software maker's
raid tools are installed because they are much simpler to parse, but for now,
it only shows the presence of the raid device itself, not disks, raid status, etc.

Version: 3.0.11
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-06-04
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, man page.  Features, bugs, fixes!

Bugs:
1. Color selector accepted '' as a value, which it would then write to config 
file, creating errors since it's not an integer value. 
2. Corrected distro id error for last fallback case, making the distro ID out
of the filename itself, that was missing the assignment to $distro.
3. mmcblk0 was showing up as an unmounted partition, due to failing to filter
mmcblk[0-9] in unmounted. 

Fixes:
1. Added missing compositor kwin_wayland to compositor detections
2. For -M, on laptops, sometimes Type: would duplicate in Chassis: type: which 
looks silly, so now it checks to make sure the two values are different before 
using the Chassis: type: data.
3. -D disk vendor, added GALAX, fixed Toshiba, which sometimes occurs other than
start of disk id string, so now it checks the whole string. This seems particularly
common in nvme devices from Toshiba. This is the only vendor I have found that 
puts the vendor string later in the device id string.
4. Added protection against unreadable but present /etc/issue. This was caused 
by a now fixed bug in OpenSuSe, which symbolically linked to create /etc/issue 
from /var/run/issue, but with 600 permissions, root read only, that is. Note that
this bug has since been fixed (now has the correct 644 permissions), but I figured 
better safe than sorry in case anyone else decides that's a good idea in the future. 
Now only sends to reader if readable. 
5. Related to 4, made reader not exit on failure, now just prints error message and
keeps going.
6. Upped maximum distro string length to 60, from 50. AntiX for example was coming
in at 48, so I decided to add some safe room now that inxi does dynamic sizing, it 
is not a big problem having very long distro id strings.

Enhancements:
1. Added basic /proc data parser to debugger. Can't get all the data or files because
it's simply too big, but grabs the basics.
2. Added vcgencmd for some ARM rasberry pi debugging.
3. ARM: add model if not found in /proc/cpuinfo, or if different. 
4. Added Tdie cpu sensor type, this is coming soon in latest kernels, so catching 
it early. Tdie will replace k10-temp sensor item temp1.
5. Added --admin extra data option, and first set of extra data, -C, which will
show CPU Errata (bugs), family, model-id, stepping (as hex (decimal) or hex if less
than or equal to 9), microcode (as hex). 
6. Battery: added with -x option, if found, attached battery driven devices, like 
wifi keyboard, mouse. If upower is present, will also try to show battery charge 
percent for those devices. Note that -B only shows the Device-X items if -x is used,
and will not show anything in -F unless there is a system, not device, battery 
present, or if -Fx is used and there is a Device battery detected. 
Added upower to recommends.
7. Basic -Dxxx disk rotation speeds added. Requires udevadm. Not all spinning disks
show rotation speeds, and it depends on udevadm, so if no rotation found, it shows 
nothing.
8. Added explicit Arco Linux and Antergos distro ID support. This requires more 
checks, but in theory, both should now show Arco Linux or Antergos instead of default 
'Arch Linux' as before, plus extra data if found, like version.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.10
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-05-21
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page.

This version is very peaceful, no big changes, just a few fixes and small new 
features added. 

This version corrects a few small glitches reported by users, and adds basic support
for disk speed report. Note that this is not as accurate as I'd like, it tries, but
there is not a lot of data to be had. Limits of disk speed seems to be, roughly:
1. most speed is reported as max board can do, not max drive can support
2. usually when speed is reported as lower than max board speed, it's correct, but,
as usual, exceptions to this were found during testing.
3. usually if drive is faster than board speed, it reports board speed, but, again,
exceptions to this rule were found during testing.

However, with this said, it's usually more or less right, at least right in terms 
of the fastest speed you can expect to get with your board. NVMe was also supported,
that's much more complicated because NVMe has >= 1 lane, and each lane has up and
down data. The reported speed is max in one direction, and is a function of the 
PCIe 1,2 20% overhead, and PCIe 3,4,5 ~1.5% overhead. inxi shows the actual usable
data rate, not the GT/s rate, which is the total transfers per second the unit 
supports. 

So due to the unreliable nature of the data, this is only a -xx option. There is
also in general no data for USB, and none for mmcblk (sd cards usually).

This feature may be enhanced with a C Perl XS library in the future, we'll see how 
that goes.

FIXES:
1. corrected an issue where a networking card of type Bridge failed to be detected.
This is now handled. This was a PCI type I'd never seen before, but it exists, and
a user had it, so now it will work as expected for this type.
2. changed the default units in weather to be m (metric) imperial (i). While this is 
not very intuitive for me, it's easier to explain I think. The previous c / f 
syntax is supported internally, and inxi will just translate c to m and f to i, so 
it doesn't matter which is or was used on a config file or with the --weather-unit 
option.
3. BSD uptime had a parsing glitch, there was a spelling variant I'd never seen in
GNU/Linux that broke the regex. This is corrected now.
4. Fixed a few small man page glitches, some ordering stuff, nothing major.
5. Fixed BSD hostname issues. There was a case where a setup could have no hostname,
inxi did not handle that correctly. This fix would have applied to gnu/linux as 
well.
6. Fixed a few bsd, openbsd mostly, dm detections, there is a secondary path in 
OpenBSD that was not checked. This also went along with refactoring the dm logic 
to be much more efficient and optimized.
7. Fine tuned dmidecode error message.
8. Fixed PCI ID issue, it was failing to catch a certain bridged network type.
9. A more global fix for unhandled tmpfs types, in this case, shm, but added a
global test that will handle all tmpfs from now on, and exclude that data from 
-p reports.

NEW FEATURES:
1. First attempt to add basic disk speed (Gb/s). Supported types: ATA, NVMe. No 
speed data so far handled or found: mmcblk; USB. Also possibly older /dev/hda 
type devices (IDE bus) may not get handled in all cases. This may get more work
in the future, but that's a long ways off. This case oddly was one where BSDs had 
support for basic disk speed reports before GNU/Linux, but that was really just 
because it was part of a single data line that inxi parsed for disk data anyway
with BSDs.
2. Man items added for -Dxx disk speed options.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.09
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-05-11
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Bug fixes, feature updates.

The main reason to release this earlier than I had hoped was because of the /sys 
permission change for serial/uuid file data. The earlier we can get this fix out,
the better for end users, otherwise they will think they have no serial data when 
they really do. 

FIXES:
1. this bug just came to my attention, apparently the (I assume) kernel people 
decided for us that we don't need to see our serial numbers in /sys unless we are 
root. This is an unfortunate but sadly predictable event. To work around this 
recent change (somewhere between 4.14 and 4.15 as far as I can tell), inxi -M and 
-B now check for root read-only and show <root required> if the file exists but 
is not user readable. I wish, I really wish, that people could stop changing stuff 
for no good reason, but that's out of my control, all I can do is adjust inxi to
this reality. But shame on whoever decided that was a good idea.

This is not technically an inxi bug, but rather a regression, since it's caused 
by a change in /sys permissions, but users would see it as a bug so I consider 
this an important fix.

Note that the new /sys/class/dmi/id permissions result in various possible things:
1. serial/uuid file is empty but exists and is not readable by user 
2. serial/uuid file is not empty and exists and is not readable by user
3. serial/uuid file does not exist
4. serial/uuid file exists, is not empty, and is readable by root

Does this change make your life better? It doesn't make mine better, it makes
it worse. Consider filing a bug report against whoever allowed this regression 
is my suggestion. 

BUGS:
1. A weather bug could result in odd or wrong data showing in weather output, this 
was due to a mistake in how the weather data was assembled internally. This error 
could lead to large datastore files, and odd output that is not all correct.

2. More of an enhancement, but due to the way 'v' is used in version numbers, 
the program_version tool in some cases could have sliced out a 'v' in the wrong
place in the version string, and also could have sliced out legitimate v values.

This v issue also appeared in bios version, so now the new rule for program_version
and certain other version results is to trim off starting v if and only if it is 
followed by a number. 

FEATURES:
1. Added in OpenBSD support for showing machine data without having to use dmidecode.
This is a combination of systcl -a and dmesg.boot data, not very good quality data 
sources, but it is available as user, and it does work. Note that BIOS systems 
are the only ones tested, I don't know what the syntax for UEFI is for the field 
names and strings. Coming soon is Battery and Sensors data, from the same sources.

Sadly as far as I know, OpenBSD is the only BSD that has such nice, usable (well,
ok, dmesg.boot data is low quality strings, not really machine safe) data. I 
have no new datasets from the other BSDs so I don't know if they have decided to
copy/emulate this method.

2. By request, and this was listed in issue #134, item no. 1, added in weather 
switchable metric/imperial output. Also added an option, --weather-unit and 
configuration item: WEATHER_UNIT with possible values: cf|fc|c|f. The 2nd of 
two in cf/fc goes in () in the output. Note that windspeed is m/s or km/h as metric, 
inxi shows m/s as default for metric and (km/h as secondary). Also fixed -w 
observation date to use local time formatting. That does not work in -W so it shows 
the default value.

3. Updated man to show new WEATHER_UNIT config option, and new --weather-unit 
option. Also fixed some other small man glitches that I had missed.

Version: 3.0.08
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-05-06
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball. New features, bug fixes.

This is a big one.

NEW FEATURES:

1. By Request: Disk vendor is now generally going to be shown. Since this uses 
empirical data to grab the vendor name, from the model string, it will not always 
find anything. When it fails to find vendor data, no vendor: item will show.

Note that some MMC devices will probably not show vendor data, but that's due to
there being no data that reveals that.

2. Extended -sx volts to also show voltage from lm-sensors if present. Many 
systems show no voltage data with lm-sensors, but now if any is found, it 
will show, same as impi.

3. Moved to lsblk as primary source for partition/unmounted filesystem, uuid, and 
label data.

Falls back to previous methods if lsblk does not return data. Some lsblk do not 
show complete data unless super user as well.

4. Refactored code to be more logical and clear. 

5. Added for OpenBSD -r: /etc/installurl file.

BUG FIXES:

1. CRITICAL: /sys/block/xxx/device/model is in some cases truncating the disk 
model name to 16 characters. This is not  an inxi bug, it's a bug with /sys itself.

To fix this, inxi now uses for GNU/Linux /dev/disk/by-id data which does not 
ever do this truncation. It's also faster I believe to read that directory 
once, filter the results, then use the data for vendor/model/serial.

this was also part of the disk vendor data feature.

2. Openbsd networking fix. Was not showing IF data, now it does.

3. Fixed bug with unmounted where sometimes md0 type partitions would show 
even though they are in a raid array.

4. Fixed disk rev, now it searches for 3 different files in /sys to get that data.

5. Fixed bug with very old systems, with sudo 1.6 or older, for some reason that 
error did not get redirected to /dev/null, so now only using sudo -n after explicit 
version test, only if 1.7 or newer.

6. Fixed a few null results in fringe cases for graphics. Resolution now shows 
NA for Hz if no hz data found. This was only present on a fringe user case 
which is unlikely to ever impact normal X installations.

7. Fixed BSD L2 cache, was showing MiB instead of KiB, wrong math.

New version, new man. Bug fixes. BSD fixes.

Bugs fixed:
1. CPU: MT/HT was wrong for old xeon, made mt detection more robust and hopefully

2. fixed /dev/mapper glitch, that make /dev/mapper links fail to get id'ed.
3. openbsd: fixed memory handler; fixed cpu flags, fixed partitions handling.
4. freebsd: fixed similar partition bugs, these were caused by the darwin patch.
5. man page: fixed top synopis syntax, thanks ESR. 
6. partitions fs: fixed possible failures with lsblk fs. lsblk: added debuggers 
so we can track down this failure in the future. 
7. added sshfs filter for disk used output, note, there is a possible syntax for 
remote fs that isn't handled: AAA:BBB that is, no :/, only the :. This makes 
explicit detection of still unknown remote fs very difficult since : is a legal 
nix filename character.

1. Added to -s for ipmi, with -x: voltage 12v,5v,3.3v,vbat; for -xx, dimm/soc p1/p2 
voltages
2. enhanced wm: feature, needed more filters and protection against redundant data 
3. basic apple osx fixes to keep it from crashing, but I'm not spending any more 
time on apple junk unless someone pays me for my time, I can't stand the product or 
company, it's the total antitheses of freedom or free software, or even openness.
4. openbsd/bsd fixes: openbsd was failing to get cpu flags due to a small oversight 
5. -C now shows bits: for the true bits of cpu, not the kernel bits. This is not 
a reliable measurement but should be right about 95+ percent of the time, and 
basically all of the time for GNU/Linux on Intel/AMD, most of the time for ARM.
When it doesn't know it does not guess, and shows N/A.
6. bsd fix for usb, was running numeric action on string value
7. fixed stderr tool for program_version, now it's hard-coded in program_values
which removes an unneeded regex search for every program version test.
8. Mate detection, switched to using mate-sesssion instead of mate-about, the 
latter is not getting updated and has the wrong version number on it.

Version: 3.0.04
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-04-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Fixes several issues.

1. issue #145 - corrects case with vm xeon where phys id skips numbers, creating 
bad array looping error.
2. for issue #143, added user PATH to static list of paths, this works around distros
that have chosen to abandon the FSH standard, sigh... This adds to number of paths that 
have to be checked, but there was no clean way to handle it otherwise.
3. For MATE, added new version source, mate-session, because mate-about was reporting 
a non-matching version number for current MATE.

Version: 3.0.03
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-04-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. NBD network block device fixes 

Two enhancements/bug fixes:
1. inxi did not have support for network block devices /dev/nbd0 type syntax in 
disks.
2. this caused a slight failure in lsblk output, so I switched to using lsblk -P
to force paired key values, which are then put into an array of hashes.

These both appeared on an ARM server system, but surprisingly, there were no ARM
specific issues at all on that system.

Both issues/enhancements tested and working fine.

Version: 3.0.02
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-04-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, new man.

Rolls up a few changes from the latest features:

1. For -Dxxx, if root, will use fdisk to try to find partition table scheme (mbr/gpt)
2. For Display: <protocol> server: will try to use loginctl if out of X and using 
--display flag to force display data and not root.

This completes more or less the very  last minute features added pre 3.0.0 version.

I wanted to get these in because the features were not super useful since they only
worked on a few systems, particulary the scheme:

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.01
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-04-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Fine tunings.

New features:
1. for a very few systems that have wmctrl installed, shows with  -xxxS, wm if present 
2. an attempt to get display protocol from out of X, using --display and loginctl

Enhancements:
1. made xorg display server and protocols show more consistently with other layout:
Display: x11 server: X.org 1.9.12 drivers: loaded: ...
if no display protocol found: 
Display: server: X.org 1.9.12 drivers: loaded: ...

This brings the -G in line with the other lines, of not putting different data types
inside of parentheses as much as possible. -I still has two of these, but so far it's
not clear how to otherwise show SSH or su/sudo/login in their respective spaces.

Debugger data collector also has something I should have added ages ago, gz filename
now includes the basic 2 digit inxi version number, like 3.0 at end, so I can readily 
determine the debugger inxi version, and thus avoid having to root through lots of
versions to find new stuff.

These are all largely cosmetic improvements, or debugger adjustments, except for -Sxxx
now offering wm: if present.

Also changed Desktop: name... (toolkit data) to: Desktop: name... tk: toolkit data 
to be more consistent, while not adding great length to the output.

These two changes should also help export to json/xml since that puts unique key/values
back into key value pairs, not merging two together.

=====================================================================================
Version: 3.0.00
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-04-09
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man. Beta / 2.9 testing completed.

inxi 3.0 is now ready for prime time. No substantial issues have been found over 
the past week. All outstanding issues and bugs have been corrected. The man page 
and help page have been edited fairly heavily to improve usability and readablity.

All work and development and support for inxi 2.3.56 is ended. No issues for 
2.3.56 will be accepted since there is no way to support that version, it 
being in a different set of languages (Gawk/Bash) than inxi 2.9/3.0 (Perl 5). 
So the sooner you move your distro package pool to new inxi, the sooner your 
users can get support for any issues with current inxi.

Beta and 2.9 prerelease testing is completed, and has resulted in a much 
better inxi than I could have hoped for.

There are so many new features and enhancements in the new inxi that it's hard 
to list them all. See previous commits for a more in depth record.

1. New options: --slots (PCI Slots); --usb 
2. Exports to json/xml with --output options
3. Every line has been enhanced, with tighter output control, better key / value 
pairings, more accurate values.
4. Line wrapping is now fully dynamic, which means inxi works down to 80 columns 
and should basically never wrap (except for very long repo lines, but that's not 
really fixable).
5. More controls, more user configuration options (see man page).
6. So many small new features that it's hard to list them all. Shows SSH in -I 
if SSH. Shows sudo/su/login in -I if relevant and detectable. Shows disk partioning 
scheme in some cases (more coming). Removes color codes if piped or redirected to 
file. 
7. All sizes are now shown in standardized KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB/PiB format, to avoid 
ambiguity about whether M or MB or MiB is meant. All internal size math is done 
using KiB, which further avoids confusion and error. Note that many disk makers 
like using MB or GB instead of MiB or GiB because it makes their disks seem 
'bigger'.
8. Sensors -s now supports IPMI sensors, in tandem with lm-sensors.

Anyway, the changelog will show better all the new features etc, I can't remember 
them all.

All current issues and glitches have been fixed, any remaining are simply new issues,
just as they would be in old inxi.

Note that in the second and third weeks of beta testing a significant number of bugs
that are in inxi 2.3.56 were fixed. 2.3.56 has been moth-balled into the inxi-legacy 
branch as binxi, to avoid mixing it up with inxi. The development branch is now 
permanently inxi-perl, aka, pinxi, since that worked so well for beta and pre-3.0 
2.9 testing and development.

This ends the pinxi/inxi development stage. All future development will proceed 
using the inxi-perl branch, and will be the same in terms of new features as pre 
inxi 2.9 was, they will be added, enhanced, as seems appropriate. 

Remember, inxi is a rolling release program, like Arch Linux, Gentoo, Debian 
Testing/Sid, and has no frozen release points, so this is simply the beginning of the
3.0 line of Perl inxi.

Thanks to everyone who contributed time, energy, effort, ideas, testing, debugging,
patience - inxi would not work without you.

-----------------------------------
New version, man page. Finished up  main man edits. Set new defaults for some options,
like --sleep and -t.

Edits to layout and language, removed some legacy options and language from man and
inxi.

Added partition table detections, rough initial stage. Only works on systems with 
udev present currently, will be expanded as we find fast tools. Since the systemd 
method is literally up to 25x slower than the udev method, it's not being considered 
except maybe as a last, last resort, and probably will never be used.

Many small bugs fixed.

Enhancements: 

1. in some cases, will detect partition table type (GTP,MBR) either 
with or without root. Uses fast method, which is not available on all systems.

2. Added IPMI sensors tools ipmitool and ipmi-sensors to -s for systems that 
use IPMI.

3. Finished man page edits and corrections. Thanks Pete.

4. Added doubled word filter for main -NGA lines, only for Card items.

5. Gave more granular uptime output: like: uptime: 23d 5h 34m

1. json/xml outputter had a bug in it that made it validate path wrong.
2. -G -xx option: compositor: for gnome-shell had a bug that would make it show 
as running when it wasn't, other strings were tripping the match on systems with
gnome-shell installed but not running, 
3. Finally fixed bug with manjaro full version distro string, and tweaked output 
to show Manjaro Linux instead of given string.

1. --no-man - this lets users turn off man installs. Only really useful for -U 
from master, since default is off for pinxi  and dev 3 branch.

Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Very new man.

Man features new section, configuration options, which lists the main config options 
users would be likely to use. 

This should help users who will never check the actual documentation web page 
realize that there are many internal configuration options available.

Many edits in man, more to come I suspect.

Bug fixes in inxi:
1. removed a few stray debuggers that were creating debugging output 
2. fixed a usb driver bug that would create warning messages from Perl (thanks Manjaro 
for finding that one)

New Option:
1. Added: --indent-min - goes with the user configuration option: INDENT_MIN 
and allows users to experiment with different indent settings. This is what trips the
auto line wrap of line starters. This may be revisited, and this switch will make it 
easier for users to see for themselves which they prefer, what trip point, etc.

This will help determine pre 3.0.0 what the default auto wrap trip point, if any, 
will be.

Added more data to debugger tool, more lsblk, which is going to need a lot more data 
to solve a new issue with dm/encrypt/lvm, initial $MANPAGE data, to see if anyone 
actually ever uses that environmental variable.

Special thanks to Manjaro for being as far as I know the first to package Perl inxi.

Or was AntiX first? Well, it was close, thanks to both.

New version, new man. Options changes 

To get rid of some non-intuitive options, I've changed some of the --alt values 
to more obvious argument names; --dmidecode --no-ssl --no-host --host

This makes them easier to remember, hopefully. 

Updated help, man pages to cover this change as well.

Added some more lsblk debugger output to try to start building enough information to
really figure out dm/encrypted/lvm and how those are actually handled internally in 
the system in terms of partitions, filesystems, etc.

Version: 2.9.04
Patch: 00
Date: 2018-03-22
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new man. Big update

New features:

1. now does not require root or 'file' to get unmounted fs type. Also, for many 
mounted partitions, rather than showing the meaningless fuseblock it will usually 
get the filesystem right.

2. -U now works with optional --man option to download man page for pinxi 
and -U 3 dev server updates. This gets around the fact I had to remove the gz files
from master to get the size small enough to make maintainers happy. Non branch 
inxi master works as before, updates both from github or from dev server, depending 
on your selection.

So now inxi and pinxi will grab the inxi.1 or pinxi.1 man file and install it on 
systems that do not have -U blocked. The -U block of course remains the same.

3. Thanks very much to the people who have been contributing in a positve way, 
helping to make inxi better. The untold number of small and large new features, 
small glitches, etc, that have been fixed this week are simply too many too list.
Many to most were inxi bugs or weaknesses, now corrected.

4. binxi branch has now been made fully operational, though I do not plan on doing 
any work beyond the mothballing of that venerable program (gawk->bash inxi), it's
fully operational, it updates, it gets its man page, but all as binxi, so you can, 
as with pinxi, run all of them separately. This officially terminates my support 
for Gawk/Bash inxi, which can be found as binxi in the inxi-legacy branch.

5. pinxi has been promoted to permanent development branch, where bug fixes, new
features, etc, will be tested, along with man page updates etc. This will help 
reduce the number of commits to master branch.

6. Audio / Network usb cards now show the true driver(s). There are often more 
than one for audio, that's a nice enancement.

7. inxi outputs to json / xml, which will probably interest some developers 
eventually, well it already did, that was going to wait, but someone wanted it.

8. Apt repo handler now supports DEB822 format, which is not an easy format to 
parse.

==========================================================

MAINTAINERS:

Note the following: despite my strong dislike for tags, every commit that touches 
either inxi or inxi.1 man page will be tagged if I think they would be something 
relevant to distro packagers. While github insists on calling my tags releases, 
I want to be crystal clear: inxi has one and only one 'release', the current master 
branch version. The tagged commits that github calls releases are NOT releases, 
they are just tagged commits. The version I release tomorrow will be the current 
master, and all previous versions will be obsolete and will not be supported.

The .gz files have been removed from the master branch history, thus shrinking it
a lot. I have removed for this reason the master-plain branch, which mirrored 
master and provided a gz free branch, but apparently this was simply ignored so 
there's no reason to keep it going. If you insist on grabbing all the branches and 
find more data in there, then please correct your practices, you are only getting 
the data from the master branch.

inxi is rolling release software and has no releases, so the tags are supposed 
to create some illusion that a tag actually means something. Since it doesn't, 
I decided to take the path of least resistance and just add an auto tagging tool 
to my commit scripts and use it when it seems appropriate, like on this commit.

All development work now will happen via the pinxi branch, so that makes the process 
a lot cleaner, since I can now basically beta test all new commmits to master.
pinxi and binxi are both standalone versions of inxi, they have their own config
and data directories, config files, man pages, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------

New Perl inxi is already way ahead of Gawk/Bash inxi, more features, more accurate,
and most bugs being fixed now are because a lot of people are contributing eyes and
testing, and are finding stuff that was wrong, or simply missing, on old inxi as 
well as on Perl inxi. Fixes to Perl inxi (>2.9) will not be rolled into to binxi
since the entire reason I spent over 4 months on this project was to never have to
touch Gawk/Bash inxi again.

Most imporant, however, is that the simple fact was, Gawk/Bash inxi has been 
nearly impossible to work on despite my following rigorous practices in coding, 
and I simply won't work with that type of stuff anymore. Perl 5.x is a true delight 
in comparison, and makes adding new features, enhancing others, far easier, or 
even possible, where it wasn't before.

On a technical level, I have tested Perl inxi heavily, and it will run on all 
Perl 5.x versions back to 5.008, which is the cutoff point. This was not that 
hard to do, which is why I picked Perl 5.x as the language. This means that 
you can drop, just as with binxi, Perl inxi onto a 10 year old system, or
older, and it will run fine, albeit a touch slowly, but much faster than binxi.

-----------------------------------------------------

So far users are really liking the new one, it's usually faster in most cases,
the output is cleaner, there's more data, more options, and basically it's 
gotten the thumbs up from all the testers, and there have been a LOT, who have
helped. I want to give a special thanks to the following distros for their
exceptional support and testing:

0. the people who hang out on irc.oftc.net #smxi. Very patient, will test things 
with astounding patience, so thanks to them. Archerseven, iotaka and KittyKatt 
have been been incredibly helpful when it comes to testing and debugging, and 
finding corner cases that I would never have found.

1. AntiX: they were the first to beta test pinxi, and found massive numbers of
bugs, and stuck with the testing for a long time. They made testing possible for
the next wave of testers, my hats off to them, I've always liked them.

2. Manjaro also was very helpful, and found more issues and enhancements.

3. Ubuntu forums users found more, and helped enhance many features

4. Mint users have been very helpful, and were the impetus for some nifty
new features, ilke switching all color codes off when output is piped or sent
to file. They have reminded me of how valuable people's views can be who may not 
share the same tech world view as you, but are still very talented and observant
individuals.

5. Slackware users provided some very thoughtful feedback, which was no surprise 
but welcome nonetheless, thanks. 

6. Same with Debian forums, again, some very useful and constructive ideas and 
observations, and some very arcane and odd hardware that exposed even more corner 
case bugs.

And several other distros were also helpful, each in their own way. Solus for 
example now has their package manager added in repos.

and a small bug for blank files there.

Second, made the --output error message more clear for bad file structure now lists
the 3 requirements: must be full path, must be writeable directory, and must have 
a file in it. 

Third, another subtle thing, after a lot of research, am trying the MiB GiB format 
because it's technically more accurate and less ambiguous than GB, which is used 
either to refer to 1000 bite blocks OR to 1024 blocks, depending on the platform etc.

So rather than hope people get it, trying that slightly more wordy format, and maybe
if people wonder what it is.

New inxi, new man, new tarball.

It's here! Perl inxi, first official release. So many changes, really too many
to list.

But here's a few:
1. of course, full rewrite to Perl 5.x. Supports as old as 5.008, as new as current.
2. Better line length nandlers. Fully dynamic, robust, shrinks and expands to fit 
either taste or viewport.
3. Long options for all options now, plus of course the short options everyone 
is used to.
4. New options: --usb; --slots (pci slot report); --sleep (change cpu sleep time);
and many more. Check --help or man page for details.
5. Vastly improved --recommends, now does per distro package recommends, and shows
only Linux data to Linux systems, and BSD data to BSD systems.
6. Hugely improved debugger as well.
7. Far more accurate output, most output is now in key/value pairs, because:
8. inxi now exports to json and xml! See --output/--output-file for info.
9. Enhancedd repo output, added deb822 type, solus 
10. Radically enhanced network data, now shows all IP / IF devices connected to
each nic, not just one, both IP v4 and v6. 
11. USB audio and network device actual drivers
12. better handling of compiler data.
13. Basic ARM machine data now, if present to inxi
14. Graphics: per card driver info alongside the original xorg drivers.
15. Better integration of partitions, RAID, unmounted partitions, and HDD data.
16. Better sensors handling of free video driver sensor data, well, not better,
it's now there, along with fan speeds for gpus.
17. RAID is enhanced, and now can show > 1 RAID type on a system, and the RAID
is improved.
18. Much improved disk/partition/memory sizing, inxi now always works internally 
with KB units, and changes them on output to the appropriate units.
19. Fully redone man page for all the new options and the long options.

And so much more. Anyway, here it is, the first release.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
Maintainer alert: Perl inxi 2.9.01 is looking good for maybe early week of 
2018-03-19 release. I'm putting the last issue requests on the last forums, 
so assuming no real further bugs found, expect Perl inxi 2.9.01 to hit around 
Monday or Tuesday. If any bugs are found, of course, those will be fixed before 
release of the new Perl inxi.

Basically, if you want to see if you can find bugs, this is the time to do it, not
AFTER release. I've posted on many forums, and have given the various distros a 
chance to help squash the bugs their users might see, some have been fantastic
(AntiX, you were the best by far), others, not so much. Their loss in the latter 
case since the purpose of beta testing is to find bugs before, not after, release.

If you want to see the differences in recommends, and dependencies, grab pinxi 
development branch here:
wget -O pinxi https://github.com/smxi/inxi/raw/inxi-perl/pinxi
or:
git clone https://github.com/smxi/inxi --branch inxi-perl --single-branch

and run: pinxi --recommends

The main thing I'd strongly urge all maintainers to add, for long term stability
and speed and reliability, is dig, which can be used if present to get very fast, 
reliable, WAN IP information.

All of the other recommends are pretty much the same, for graphics, xdpyinfo,
xrandr, and glxinfo. For networking, ip or ifconfig, along with dig. For all usb 
related identification, lsusb, unfortunately, I wish I could get rid of that tool,
it's very slow, but I can't. The --recommends output shows the complete set.

Obviously, Bash and Gawk are no longer recommends, nor are the tools like grep, 
sed, tr, wc, etc, all those are done with Perl, so any shell plus Perl 5.08 or
newer Perl 5.x is all that's really required, beyond normal system reporting 
tools like lspci etc.

For json/xml export, two Perl modules are needed, again, see --recommends

Changes:
-----------------------------------
No real changes, this will probably be the very last Gawk->Bash inxi 2.3.x release.

Making sure tarball etc is up to date, so it can be stored in 'tarball's branch.

MAINTAINERS:
Pinxi 2.9.00-xxx-p (inxi-perl branch) is nearing completion of its beta test cycle, 
and, barring any new issues or bugs (TEST IT NOW AND REPORT ISSUES NOW!), I expect 
to release pinxi 2.9.00 as inxi 2.9.01 shortly after I complete the advanced 
RAID feature, which should be this week.

If no real issues appear during the following week after the inxi 2.9.0 release, it
will be moved to inxi 3.0.0, as the first stable Perl inxi release.

There will be a new branch, inxi-legacy, that will have the Gawk->Bash inxi 2.3..56
files for historical purposes only. No further work will be done on inxi 2.3 from 
now on.

Version: 2.3.53
Patch: 00
Date: 2017-12-07
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball, new man page. This should fix the Rizen multithreaded 
cpu output issues. Now inxi handles > 8 cores in terms of output filters, 
descriptions, correctly noting that it's multithreaded.

Because AMD has entered the Multithreading game, I've changed the trade term:
HT - HyperThreading to MT - MultiThreading to support both Intel and AMD variants.

Updated CPU output filters to also account for these very large core counts.

I believe this commit now adds full support for the new Ryzen series, but I'll have
to see when it comes to other variants that may appear. I've tried to future proof
the MT tests, but I won't know of those are fully functional and accurate until
inxi sees the real data.

Version: 2.3.51
Patch: 00
Date: 2017-11-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball. This is an attempt at a fix for issue #129

Because I don't want to break existing cpu logic, I just added in a rizen switch,
which will just use cpu_core_count value, then trigger HT output.

This fix may or may not work, but the issue poster vanished and has not followed up.

For now I'm keeping this a Ryzen specific adjustment, but it may be safe to extend
it further, that is, if siblings > 1 && siblings = 2 * cores then it's HT.

New version, new tarball, bug fix for -R raid, zfs. Improved filters, clutter

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.3.49
Patch: 00
Date: 2017-11-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball, new man page. This is the first attempt to correct an
issue a forum poster raised, which is the fact that despite the fact that GNU/Linux
has had reasonably ok zfs support for years now, inxi only tested for zfs on bsd 
systems.

This has been corrected. Due to the complexity of handling software raid, inxi
will now test first for ZFS data, if none is found, it will then test for 
/proc/mdstat.

In a perfect world I'd like to have full dynamic Raid support, but I'm missing
all the key ingredients required to add that:

1. systems to test on
2. software raid, I don't use it
3. data collection for non mdraid and zfs software raid, including the values
possible to gather from all non software raid.

Basically, the only way I'd extend -R raid option is if I get direct ssh access to 
a machine that uses the alternate software raid type, otherwise it would take
forever to figure out the options.

Since the number of people who might be actually running zfs and mdraid and 
using inxi probably numbers in the 10 globally, I figured this solution was a fine
way to handle adding zfs without messing up mdraid, which is more common on linux.

It also does not break BSDs, since bsds as far as I know don't use mdraid, and don't
have /proc/mdraid in the first place.

Also redid the man page to add -! 41, -! 42, -! 43, -! 44 options, which bypass 
curl, fetch, wget, and all of them, respectively. Plus making the lines less wide.

That should make those people who actually use 80 column wide vi as an editor 
happy, lol.

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.3.46
Patch: 00
Date: 2017-11-26
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball. Added an optional downloader: Perl HTTP::Tiny

Note that this is the last choice because it's slow, the order has been revised:

1. curl
2. wget
3. fetch
4. Perl 5 HTTP::Tiny
5. OpenBSD ftp

wget has been downgraded due to the recent 1.19-2 bug with wget -O that did 
not get resolved quickly, and which should never have been released since 
that's a basic wget action, which means they aren't testing gnu wget the way 
they should be.

All inxi downloaders can now use this option. However, in my tests it's signicantly 
slower to use HTTP::Tiny than curl or wget, so inxi will test for the downloaders 
in that order. While -i uses dig as it's primary IP tool, if dig is not installed, 
the IP will follow the same downloader priority. -U and -w/-W use downloaders.

Because HTTP::Tiny is optional, and is merely used if wget/curl/fetch are not 
installed, I would not consider Perl to be a real dependency yet, just an option, so 
I guess for packager maintainers, Perl should be added as a recommends, or a 
dependency if you want to fully support the debugger options (Core Modules).

While I'm still not sure which Perl modules I'm going to be using, I'm sticking 
for now to Core Modules, the standard, with some experimental exceptions that 
would only be used if the user had them present.

Long term the goal is to get rid of as many dependencies as possible, replacing 
them were possible with Perl tools, but this is going to take forever, if it
ever happens, so don't hold your breath.

In the future, I expect more and more components that were gawk to be rewritten
to Perl (Core Modules), slowly, however, very slowly.

Updated --recommends to indicate the downloader options more clearly as well.

Added new options for bypassing curl (-! 41), fetch (-! 42) wget (-! 43), or
curl, fetch, and wget (-! 44) to disable all of them. This is in case one of 
those is broken or you want to test Perl downloader, mostly.

Also cleaned up debugger output and made debugger portable to other scripts.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Updated the inxi upater options, removed some legacy 
branches, simplified the options. This corresponds to updates on github where
I'm finally bringing the alternate location self updater back into operational
state after a long dormant period.

Also, and this may be of interest to some maintainers, please note, there is
a new branch: master-plain which does NOT have the gz files inxi.1.gz and
inxi.tar.gz

If you want to avoid the big clones, you can use that branch with this command:
git clone https://github.com/smxi/inxi --branch master-plain --single-branch

And that should only track the basic 3 files: inxi inxi.1 and inxi.changelog

This fixes issue #94

New version, tarball, man page. This closes issue #122. Adds support for including
nvme disk capacity in full disk capacity listing. Adds nvme name/serial/firmware 
revision number. The latter is a new -Dxx output option. Note that as far as I could
tell, so far, nvme is the only disk type that has firmware revision data.

Added support for nvme disk temperature as well, that requires the cli tool nvme.

Updated AMD microarchitecture list to be more granular and complete. Added Intel
microarch type. Note that they are releasing a few new microarchitectures soon but I
was not able to find any model numbers for those.

Version: 2.3.37
Patch: 00
Date: 2017-08-23
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Deprecated xiin uploader, which completes the deprecation 
of the xiin.py tool, which is going to become obsolete when python 3 fully replaces python 2.

Since the odds of perl being around and stable are far higher than the odds of xiin.py
even working on python 3, I'm getting ahead of the race. Plus Perl is nicer to work with.

And Perl is a lot faster. I mean, a lot. Not slightly.

And it also works on much older systems, and does not have that Python version < 2.6 
failure due to changing Python syntax even between sub versions. xiin.py never ran on
Python 2.5 even when it was relatively recent, which is one reason I'm removing all Python
from inxi.

Basically xiin.py worked only on Python 2.6 or 2.7, period.

Oh, and also handled issue #115 by not making -B show -M data.

Patch: 00
Date: 2017-08-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes issue #119 

The issue was not so much with xiin.py as with some new values in /sys that would 
hang tree traverse, however, in order to remove the python dependency (except for
uploading -xx@ debugger data, until I can figure out how to do it with Perl), I 
rewrote the tree traverse tool into Perl, which also makes it a lot faster and 
easier to work with.

This issue appeared on kernel 4.11 as far as I can tell, some new values in /sys make 
the traverse hang if it tries to read the values, **/parameters/** and **/debug/** seem 
to be the main culprits, but inxi doesn't need that data anyway for debugging purposes
so it's just excluded.

New version, new tarball. This closes issue #118, inxi had failed all along to handle 
the conversion from mA hours to Wh, and had a math glitch too for charge (ma).

as common internally as Wh or something.

Anyway, it should be fixed.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. This corrects many 80 column width line wraps, including on:
-o, -p, -l, -u, -P, -S, -G, -N, -A

Now most output should tend to not wrap, though some strings are unpredictable and 
will have to be trimmed by adding them to the min size trimmers one by one.

But it's much better than it was.

Note the following changes required to make the wraps more consistent:

-S - the gcc/bits have been made separate, like: bits: 32 gcc: 5.3
-C - the new microarchitecture -x option now is: arch: K7 [for example]
     cache wraps to next line with arch. with -f, bmips now shows on same line as 
     arch/cache

Will need some updates to bring the family/model ids to fully current, but should show data for most

Note that while /proc/cpuinfo has the family/model id in decimal, the values are actually generally
found as hexadecimal, so inxi translates that interally so we can store the data the way it is presented.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This corrects a case I'm seeing where wayland/mir are running desktop 
but Xorg has not started, which means inxi can't get the video driver from Xorg.0.log as with X.

Added in extra data collection from lspci -v to include the driver for graphics card. this is 
only used, for now, if the initial Xorg based driver test works.

Note that this may also work for systems that have not yet started X out of X, in console, I'm 
not sure about that, but the graphics driver reporting should be improved.

Note that I'm not yet linking the driver to the specific card/device, it's just going to show 
in a comma separated list, I couldn't find multi card systems where the card types are different, 
like amd gpu with nvidia card, for example.

But this should correct an issue, at least to start, with expanding wayland support for systems 
that don't use or have not started the desktop with Xorg/X11 etc.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Bug fix for GLX/OpenGL output. There was an unhandled case with 
core profile data being null, which in turn triggered a bash oddity, where if the IFS is 
\n for an array, and if the value of one element is '', then bash ignores that and does 
not simply set an empty array key as you'd expect. The correction was to change the IFS 
to ^, which worked fine for empty array values.

However, since this bug will impact anyone with empty opengl core profile data, I recommend 
updating inxi.

Also, added support for two smaller wm, Sawfish and Afterstep.

This is a good source for lists of wm:  http://www.xwinman.org/ http://www.xwinman.org/others.php 

However, that does not show how to ID it, so i have to do it on a case by case, but I'll
add an issue for showing how to get your wm of choice if it's missing to inxi.

Also, changed the slightly inaccurate:

GLX Renderer: .....GLX Version: .... 

to

OpenGL: renderer: ...... version: .....

Version: 2.3.15
Patch: 00
Date:  2017-06-08
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. New option -! 40 which lets you get gfx information out of X.

Default will get data from display :0, but if you append :[display-number] to -! 40, it will 
use that display instead, for example: inxi -! 40:1 would get information from display 1. Note
that most multi-monitor setups use :0 for both monitors, depending on how it's setup.

This will also let users see any desktop information based on xrop -root output, but it will 
depend how it works based on how environmental variables have been set. gnome and kde, which use XDG for 
primary detection would not work, for example.

Version: 2.3.14
Patch: 00
Date:  2017-06-08
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This corrects an issue I noticed a while ago, glxinfo and xpdyinfo
used to not work as root in X, but they do now. So I've removed the root tests for graphics 
output, and now only rely on the returned data to determine the output when in X. Out of X 
behavior remains the same.

Note that at some point I'll have to see if wayland systems have usable reporting tools to get 
screen resolution, opengl info, and so on, but that will have to come one step at a time.

Version: 2.3.13
Patch: 00
Date:  2017-06-08
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. Shows as default OpenGL core profile version number. 
-xx option will show OpenGL compatibility version number as well, though that's largely useless
information for most users, thus the -xx. Note that this reverses the default, which previously
showed OpenGL version, which is actually the compatibility version.

This should resolve #105 pull request, though it does it differently, by switching the default 
output to what is more relevant, and offering the compatibility version as an optional output item.

Note that much of the glx information will probably change to more neutral terms once wayland support 
starts growing, and systems without xwayland etc libraries appear.

Further note that non free drivers showed the OpenGL core profile version numbers all along, so really 
this simply corrects misleading output for free drivers.

Version: 2.3.12
Patch: 00
Date:  2017-06-06
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, man page, tarball. ARM cpu core count bug fix. First attempt to add Wayland 
and compositor support. 

This finally implements a first try at mir/wayland detection, along with basic handling of actual 
display server type output. 

New output for Display Server:  Display Server: x11 (X.Org 1.19.0) driver: nvidia

Note that since almost all current Wayland systems will have X.org also installed, for the time 
being, the data in the parentheses will be from X.org regardless of what display server is detected running 
the actual desktop. Out of the desktop, console, the only thing that will show is x data..

No other data is available to me yet until I get way more debugger data so I can see what information the various 
implementations of wayland without x tools actually makes available, my guess is it won't be much.

Also experimental -xx option: -G shows compositor, but only for wayland/mir currently.

I have no idea if this will work at all, but it's worth giving it a try as a rough beginning to
start handling the wide range of wayland compositors being created.

This feature will probably take several versions to get stable.

Also added new debugger data collector data for wayland information, but the pickings are slim, to
put it mildly.

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.3.11
Patch: 00
Date:  2017-05-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. This corrects several oversights of the 2.3.10 IPv6 update.

Now there is an -x option for -i that will show the additioanl IPv6 address data for scope global,
temporary, and site. Also a fallback for unhandled scope: unknown. If the tool 'ip' is used, it will
filter out the deprecated temp site/global addresses, ifconfig tool does not appear to offer this 
option.

Also changed is that now ipv6 address always shows, it's not an -x option. Probably about time to
start rolling out ip v6 data to users now that ip v6 is starting, slowly, to be used more.

Another small change, the link address for ipv6 is changed from ip-v6: to ip-v6-link so that it's 
more clear which IP v6 address it is.

The last commit had a significant logic error in it that did not distinguish between the link address,
which is what should have only shown, and the remaining possible addresses.

I've tried to get a basic bsd support, but it's difficult to know the variants of ifconfig output syntax

Note that this bug is not universal, but I believe this will make inxi more right than wrong

requested, in most cases, but rather the altitude of the weather station data assigned to that
location request.

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.3.6
Patch: 00
Date:  2016-12-19
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is a significant change, but inxi should handle it smoothly.

While default configs remain in /etc/inxi.conf, the user overrides now use the following order of tests:

1. XDG_CONFIG_HOME / XDG_DATA_HOME for the config and log/debugger data respectively. 

2. Since those will often be blank, it then uses a second priority check:
   $HOME/.config $HOME/.local/share to place the inxi data directory, which was previously here:
   $HOME/.inxi
   
3. If neither of these cases are present, inxi will default to its legacy user data: $HOME/.inxi as before

In order to make this switch transparent to users, inxi will move the files from .inxi to the respective
.config/ .local/share/inxi directories, and remove the .inxi directory after to cleanup.

Also, since I was fixing some path stuff, I also did issue 77, manual inxi install not putting man pages in
/usr/local/share/man/man1, which had caused an issue with Arch linux inxi installer. Note that I can't help
users who had a manual inxi install with their man page in /usr/share/man/man1 already, because it's too risky
to guess about user or system intentions, this man location correction will only apply if users have never
installed inxi before manually, and have no distro version installed, unlike the config/data directory, 
which does update neatly with output letting users know the data was moved.

Note that if users have man --path set up incorrectly, it's possible that the legacy man page would show up
instead, which isn't good, but there was no perfect fix for the man issue so I just picked the easiest way, 
ignoring all man pages installed into /usr/share/man/man1 and treating them as final location, otherwise
using if present the /usr/local/share/man/man1 location for new manual  install users.

Also, for users with existing man locations and an inxi manually installed, you have to update to inxi current,
then move your man file to /usr/local/share/man/man1, then update man with: mandb command (as root), after that
inxi will update to the new man location.

Also added some more XDG debugger data as well to cover this for future debugger data.

This closes previous issue #77 (man page for manual inxi install does not go into /usr/local/share/man/man1) and 
issue 101, which I made today just to force the update.

Just as a side note, I find this absurd attempt at 'simplifying by making more complex and convoluted' re the XDG 
and .config and standard nix . file to be sort of tragic, because really, they've just made it all way more complicated,
and since all 3 methods can be present, all the stuff has to be tested for anyway, so this doesn't make matters cleaner
at all, it's just pointless busywork that makes some people happy since now there's even more rules to follow, sigh.

Version: 2.3.5
Patch: 00
Date:  2016-12-02
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This will matter to some users, inxi had failed to add 'modesetting' 
graphics driver, so it would not show in output, which causes support issues for users of that specific
driver, like some cases of Intel. Also inxi would always have failed to show it unloaded in cases where
radeon/nouveau were used but it had been loaded by xorg to begin with. So probably worth updating packages
I'd say.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Extended support and tests for vm id to include better BSD
handling, and legacy linux. VM id will remain a work in progress, and will probably 
require a few fixes for fringe cases. Nice to have would be things like OpenBSD's
vm which is difficult to detect. However, I believe this should handle roughly 99% of
realworld vm id cases, except for some commercial stuff that will require more data.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New feature, new tarball, new version number.

Now -M shows device type, like desktop, laptop, notebook, server, blade, vm (and tries to get vm type).

vm detection will take more work, for now I'm just going for the main ones used, but it will certainly
miss some because it's hard to detect them in some cases unless you use root features. Also note, in
most cases a container I believe will display as a vm, which is fine for now.

For BSDs, and older linux, there is a dmidecode fallback detection as well.

New version, new tarball, new man page. 

Basic support added for Budgie desktop detection. This is waiting more data, so the support will be
missing the version information. Go Budgie!!

Added /var/tmp and /var/log and /opt to basic partition data: -P
This will probably not impact more than a handful of people in the world, but that's fine.

Modified the static BIOS in -M to now show UEFI for actually UEFI booted systems, and, ideally,
UEFI [Legacy] for UEFI booting in bios legacy mode, and BIOS for all others. Hopefully this will
work ok, we'll see.

New Feature, new version, new man page, new tarball. Laptop users should be happy, 
-B option now shows, if available, battery data. Quite good data for systems 
with /sys battery data, only rudimentary for systems using dmidecode (BSDs). 
dmidecode has no current voltage/charge/current supported capacity.

Main row shows charge and condition. Condition shows you have much capacity the 
battery currently has vs its design capacity. Charge shows the Wh/percent of 
current capacity of battery (NOT the rated design capacity).

-x adds battery vendor/model info, and battery status (like, charging, discharging, 
full).

-xx adds battery serial number and voltage information. Note that voltage information
is presented as Current Voltage / Designed minimum voltage.

-xxx adds battery chemistry (like Li-ion), cycles (note: there's a bug somewhere in
that makes the cycle count always be 0, I don't know if that's in the batteries,
the linux kernel, but it's not inxi, just FYI, the data is simply 0 always in all 
my datasets so far.

For dmidecode output, the location of the batter is also shown in -xxx

Changes: updated inxi updaters to use github locations.

I will do this commit once for googlecode, and once for github, after that, 
all commits will go only to github.

inxi moves to github, despite my dislike of for profit source repos, and git,
I decided that I just don't have the time or energy to do it right, so I'm going
to use github.

The project is already moved, though I have left inxi up for the time being on 
code.google.com/p/inxi until I move the wiki to http://smxi.org

Everything is pretty much the same, the project url is:

https://github.com/smxi/inxi

The direct download link for the gz is: 

https://github.com/smxi/inxi/raw/master/inxi.tar.gz

git pull is:

git pull https://github.com/smxi/inxi master

svn checkout url:

https://github.com/smxi/inxi

And that's about it.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes a bug with the last fix for KDE Plasma version. It was
showing Frameworks version, which is apparently NOT the same as the plasma version.

Also added debugger kde versioning to make this stuff less of an ordeal for data collection.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Got a good fix for the kde version issue from the lads at
#kde-devel, now using kf5-config --version  which gives similar output to kded4 --version

I use this for both 4 and 5, but since 4 has worked fine for years, I'll just use this for 5
and later.

Version: 2.2.24
Patch: 00
Date:  2015-06-15
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, new tarball. Adapted to deal with yet another silly pointless change from
normal, in this case, sddm decided that using a .pid or .lock file in /run was too easy
so they changed to some session id type string in the /run/sddm/ directory.

Speaking for myself, I find such pointless changes from anything resembling normal behaviors
to the reason that gnu freedesktop systems will never achieve significant desktop use globally.

Also, in the same vein, added debuggers to try to figure out what plasma5/kde 5 is using
internally to give command line version information. Again, something pointless internally
was changed, thus breaking something that had faintly resembled an api, which is of course
why desktop gnu linux will never actually take off, developers in the real world have no
interest in chasing after such pointless and never ending churn in even the most trivial 
areas of the OS, let alone the core.

inxi remains however as a log of this ongoing churn and lack of discipline, and so remains
an interesting process of observation, and a way for users to try to avoid the constant
changes in simple system queries that should really never change, so I can see a reason
to keep it going since it's obvious that the actual foss ecosystem itself will not and apparently
cannot grasp that it is the lack of stable apis, methods, etc, that has kept desktop gnu linux
from achieving any actual real world success or popularity, and that is the actual problem
that should be fixed, not some pointless internal change to something.

On the source repo front, maintainers, I still can't find an acceptable alternative to the
impending shutdown of googlecode. github is a for profit venture that people who seem totally
void of any sense of history believe is actually going to be around longer than say, sourceforge,
or googlecode, as a legitimate source hosting site.

I'd welcome any suggestions. So far all the options are bad that I can find.

Top preference is svn, but if git is the absolute only other choice for an otherwise good option,
I'd consider git, but it's a horrible option for inxi because of how inxi development and debugging
works, vs how git works. ie, svn branches are perfect, git branches are totally wrong.

I may end up just hosting the svn on my own servers to avoid having to move yet again when the next
for profit flakey site decides to close up or monetize the source hosting.

The original idea of googlecode was for google to 'pay its dues to the foss community', but apparently
they got bored with that idea, plus of course, the ongoing total failure of google to deal with 
automated spam, which has always been a huge bug in the core google corporate culture. But googlecode
was by far the best option I've come across, it was done by a deep pocketed corporation not for profit
for pretty good reasons, and was never intended to be a profit center, which is the closest I could
see for a non free option. 

Setting up svn gui stuff however is a royal pain and requires ongoing maintainance for the life of
the software, which is NOT fun, nor will I sign up for that obligation.

I may end up moving to github anyway, even though git truly sucks for inxi and myself, but it's an 
idea I find fairly vile, apparently free software (sic) authors seem to have no grasp of the concept
of fredom when it comes to source code hosting, judging by the absurd popularity of github as the
default go to source repo. Their website is pathetic as well, which isn't very promising.

So we'll see where it goes, I think I have until august to decide what to do for source hosting.

Since I'm old enough to have seen sourceforge and now googlecode do the same thing, along with a lot
of other options, to say github won't do this too is delusional, what you can almost certainly say is it 
will do it, the only question is when. But, just as Linus did with his non free linux kernel version
control, people will stick with the non free stuff until you realize you can't use it anymore, because 
it is non free. Free software hosted on non free source repos is to me one of the most absurd and
stupid things I've ever heard of to be honest.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Tiny change. Added /etc/devuan_version file to distro id to handle
the switched file name. Kudos to anyone out there fighting to create a working alternative
to the unreliable and buggy and windows emulating systemd, I wish devuan luck. Maybe between
devuan and gentoo and slackware we can save the free software core systems before it's too late.

Version: 2.2.22
Patch: 00
Date:  2015-05-30
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Modified slightly -tc and -tm output to fix a 
pet peeve of mine. Now, if -I, -b, -F, or anything that can trigger the memory: used/total
in Information line is not used, -tm will always show the system used/total ram data on the 
first line of the Memory item of -t output.

Also, if -xtc (trigger ram data in cpu output) is used, and -I is not triggered, and -tm is
not triggered, will also show system used/total ram data on the cpu first line.

I'd found it odd that this data did not appear when -tcm or -tm or -xtc were used, so this is
now fixed. I used the -t option a fair amount to find memory/cpu use issues, and usually I
don't use the option with other options, so the lack of total system ram data was odd.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. A desktop id fix, Mate id failed, mate moved to a more

Changes:
-----------------------------------

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, updated man page, new tarball. Updated -r to for portage gentoo sources. This should work
fine for all derived distros like Sabayon as well. The test looks for:
/etc/portage/repos.conf/ and type -p emerge
if found will then grab the repos from the source files found.

Note that the logic for this was almost identical to that used for rpm so it was an
easy addon. Please let us know if you have an issue and provide data samples of relevant
files.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Two great bug report, issues. 

1. Tightened runit init detection to use proc, note that if runit works on BSDs inxi will
   require more data to properly detect it on BSDs..
2. Use openrc runlevel tests natively if openrc detected.
3. Fixed subtle issue with alias to inxi file and paths.
4. Added rc-status data collection for debugger, improved debugger data collector handling
   of bsd and other tests to note absent if not there in file names.

-----------------------------------
New Version, new tarball.

Fixed bugs in Epoch init system detection, caused false positives in systems booted on
SysVinit, but with Epoch installed. Epoch turns out to be in PID 1 == epoch (/proc/1/comm)
so that's easy to fix.

Also fixed spacing isxue with OpenRC output in -I line.

Version: 2.2.16
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-11-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Very small update, added sddm id to dm detecfion. Because Arch linux, 
at least on the system I got data from, is not using .pid/.lock extensions, but other systems
are, I'm adding sddm AND sddm.pid detection. This required changing the id to use explicit -f
for test, not the previous -e, which will force only files, not directories, to trigger yes case.

No other changes, but it's worth updating to this because distros may start using sddm in the not so
distant future, it's beta currently though.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Debian has for some reason broken procps / uptime support, for
as of yet unknown reasons, so rather than wait to see the bug resolved, I'm just removing
uptime as a depenendency, though this is a short term hack only because we don't know
why it was removed from procps or if that was just a mistake, or if other things as well might
be vanishing from procps. Am leaving in however uname as dependency because inxi cannot
determine what platform it is when it starts without that.

New version, new tarball. Bug fix for regression introduced in last versions. Double

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes broken slackpkg handling in -r, and, using the same fix,
fixes a single scenario with apt, where there is only sources.list, no .d/*.list files. 
I was assuming that the file name would print out in the output of single file grep, 
but that only happens with multiple files.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Mostly bsd fixes, a few for linux disk info.

Added support, basic, for bsd hard disks, and optical disks.

Added hard disk total/percent used for BSDs, sort of.

These are mostly just hacks since the data isn't easily available from system
standard tools, though I could on freebsd use gpart I guess but that's another tool
needed, and another method, too much work imo for small results.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Cleaned up and made more consistent the cpu max/min output.

Now the short form, the -b/-v1 form, and the -C forms are all similar.

Also, added a few hacks to try to extract cpu max speed from cpu model string in
either sysctl -a OR /var/run/dmesg.boot data in freebsd/openbsd. Sometimes it may
work if that data was in the model string. It's a hack, but will do until we get
better data sources or they update their sources to list more data.

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.2.5
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-09-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes a long standing weakness with min/max cpu speed
handling. Or rather, non handling, since that data only showed in rare cases on short form
(inxi no args) output. Now it uses /sys query to determine min/max speed of cpu, and uses
that data to override any other min/max data discovered.

Still uses /proc/cpuinfo for actual speeds per core. The assumption in this is that all
cares will have the same min/max speeds, which is generally going to be a safe assumption.

Now in short form, inxi, output, it will show actual speed then (max speed) or just (max)
if actual speed matches max speed. Same for -b short CPU output.

For long, -C output, shows max speed before the actual cpu core speeds per core. 

With -xx, and in multi cpu/core systems only, shows if available min/max speeds.

Note that not all /sys have this data, so it doesn't show any N/A if it's missing.

Version: 2.2.4
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-09-10
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Mostly bsd changes, except for downloader options, which now
permit wget/curl/(openbsd ftp)/(bsd fetch) interchangeably.

This lets more standard downloader defaults in bsds, as well as curl on gnu/linux systems
without triggering an error of missing wget.

1. Fixed cpu core issues on bsds, now shows core count + if > 1, cpus total.

2. Now shows OS instead of Distro on short/long output, since each bsd is an OS.

3. fixed vmstat issues for used memory outputs

Also fixed potential failures with cpu core count array by making it a ',' separated array.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Contains a major bug fix for a regression introduced in 2.2.2

-m/-M would always show requires root for dmidecode no matter what. Also improved dmidecode
error messages/handling.

Also, a fix for no display card data, now shows as expected no card data

Most other fixes are for bsd, mostly openbsd.

1. Added a class for network devices in freebsd pciconf

2. Added -r support for openbsd

3. Fixed some cpu issues for openbsd

4. Fixed an issue in openbsd/freebsd where client version data failed to get cleaned

5. Changed inxi short form output for bsds to show OS data instead of kernel data.

6. BSDs, maybe all, different syntax in xorg.0.log made unloaded gfx drivers not show, 
   that is fixed now.
   
-p fixed file system type in -p/-P for openbsd, now shows.

-I / inxi short - fixed used memory, did not show in openbsd, now does.

-f fixed cpu flags in openbsd, now works

-C corrected corrupted cpu data outputs, in openbsd at least, maybe also freebsd

-C added an openbsd hack to sometimes show cpu L2 cache

-m/-M fixed/improved dmidecode error handling for all systems

modified handling of dmesg.boot data, synched so gawk can parse better.

Version: 2.2.00
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-08-18
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. Maintainers, this is the official release of -m feature.

I have collected enough datasamples to allow for reasonably fine grained corrections, estimates,
warnings about unreliable capacity now, and have fixed all major failures. 

Also, because this stuff is filled out by people somewhere, or not, some fields often are just
empty, or contain the default values, ie, they are worthless. inxi shows N/A for those situations,
it means there is really no actual data to show you.

This feature, sadly, well never be totally reliable, because dmi data is frankly junk, especially
dmi type 5 and 16, which is what is supposed to tell you total capacity of memory array, and the
maximum module size (type 5). However, this data is totally random, often it is right, sometimes
it is wrong. Sometimes type 5 is right and type 16 is wrong, sometimes the other way. And since
type 5 is only present in some systems, it's not reliable anyway.

What is reliable and always right is the actually installed memory per device, ie, sticks. I have
not seen any errors in that, so that seems to be actually coming from the system itself. type 5 / 16
sadly are clearly entered in manually by some poorly paid engineers out there in the world, and are
often total fictions, either far too small, or far too big, or whatever.

inxi will attempt to correct all clear logic errors, and whenever it changes the listed data from 
type 5/16, it notes either (est) or (check). (est) means it is a good guess, one I am comfortable making,
(check) means it is either an unreliable guess, or that what the system is reporting is so unlikely that
even though inxi is showing it, it doubts it could actually be true, or at least, it thinks you
should check this yourself. 

-m has 3 extra data options, -x prints the part number, if found, and the max module size, if type 5
is present. inxi does NOT attempt to guess at max module size based on what is installed, it only will
correct a listed max module size if installed modules are > than listed max size. Usually part numbers,
if present, are all you need to order a new stick.

-xx shows serial number, manufacturer (often empty, or just random alphanumeric identifiers, but sometimes
they list the actual company name, which is helpful. It also shows, if type 5 data is present, single/double
bank.

-xxx as usual shows largely useless data that may be of interest to soemone, like if ram type is synchronous, 
memory bus width data, and module voltage (type 5 data).

This feature will never be reliable I am sad to say because the source data itself is random and much
has been filled out, or not filled out, by engineering drones somewhere out there in the underpaid
world. The ranges of errors are so wide that inxi just has to check what is possible, reasonable, unlikely,
etc, to generate its numbers. In other words, this is NOT just parsing dmidecode output, that is the raw
material only, sad to say.

So this is it, for better or worse. All bug / issue reports with this MUST come with a full:
inxi -xx@14 
hardware data upload, run as root. 

Also, much to my annoyance, this feature requires root, since /dev/mem needs root to be read, and I assume
the dmi table, so that is a departure from normal inxi standards, as is the low quality input, and thus,
output, data, though I can guarantee that what inxi tells you is in most cases on average more accurate than
what dmidecode tells you, since dmidecode simply prints out what it finds in the dmi table, and nothing else,
in whatever order it finds it, from what I can see, ie, you also cannot trust the order of dmidecode output.

I had been hoping that /sys would start to contain memory data like it does mobo/system data, but it never
happened so I finally decided to just do the ram thing, require dmidecode, require root/sudo, and that's
that.

There will be issue reports, you can help them by looking up the mobo stats/specs yourself and listing them
in the issue, so I don't have to do it. I use the tool at crucial.com which is very accurate and also very 
complete in terms of all possible hardware out there. 

I would trust that tool before trusting the companies that have the least reliable data, like ASUS.

Much thanks to everyone who is contributing datasets, and the distros, particularly siduction, that really 
were very helpful in this process, by finding more and more failure cases that helped me start to tighten
the logic, and make it more and more robust. Special thanks to Mikaela, of #smxi irc.oftc.net, who came up
with two systems that both required a full redo of the logic, and thus who helped a lot in this process.

Patch: 01
Date:  2014-08-17
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New patch version, new tarball. Another error case dataset, wrong cap, wrong max mod
size, derived mod size 2gb, listed cap 8, but 2 slots, ie, 2gb x 2 == 4. Made this
retain the listed size, but adds (check) to it because either max mod size is wrong
or cap is wrong.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Fixed bad assumption, DMI type 0 is not always before other
types, in at least one case, it is last, so can't use that as trigger to start loop.

Now using: Table at .. which is always at start of dmi output.

Also, changed size output per module to be in MB GB TB instead of all mB, since modules
are sold by GB or MB, the data should show that as well. Also shortens output.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Another logic redo to handle a fringe case (dmidecode places
type 17 in front of type 16), now each array is created as a multidimenstional, 2x array,
and each device is a 3 dimensional array. This seems to clean up the problems with bad
ordering of dmidecode data.

Version: 2.1.96
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-08-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. This version hopefully brings inxi closer to
at least making good guesses when the data is bad for ram, and hopefully will not break
too many cases where it was actually right but seemed wrong.

Unfortunately, dmidecode data simply cannot be relied on, and is FAR inferior to the type
of data inxi tries in general to present users, ie, taken directly from the system, and,
ideally, more accurate than most other tools. But in this case, there is just no way to get
the data truly accurate no matter how many hacks I add.

But if you have bad data, then submit: inxi -xx@ 14 so I can take a look at the system,
and see if I can modify the hacks to improve that data.

Version: 2.1.95
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-08-13
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Attempting to handle bad extra data for max module size, sometimes
it is too big, and sometimes too small. Changed data gathering to use arrays, then print/process
the arrays once they are assembled.

Now it will get rid of any max module size if it's greater than the calculated capacity, and it
will generate an estimated capacity/max module size if they are clearly wrong because actual
module sizes are greater than listed max size, or capacity is less than greatest module sizes times
number of devices.

Not perfect, but it never is, this covers more cases now correctly than before.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Realized that I can on some systems also add
maximum supported module size, and module voltage. Most systems do not have this data,
but some do. It's Type 5 item in dmidecode.

Getting the type 6 data however is too hard, and even using type 5 assumes that the 
system only has one physical memory array, but that's fine given how few systems
probably will have this information in the first place.

Version: 2.1.93
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-08-13
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. Fixed man page errors, improved man page explanations of -m
features. Changed output syntax to be more consistent, now each main array line starts with:

Array-X capacity: (where X is an integer, counting from 1)

and each device line starts with:
Device-X: (where X is an integer incremented by 1 for each device, and starting at 1
for each array. I have no data sets that contain > 1 physical memory array, if one appears,
I may need to patch the output to link the array handles with the device handles explicitly.

Made memory bus width output more clear, and added in a hack to correct dmidecode output errors,
sometimes total width > data width, and sometimes data width is > total width, so using always
greatest value for total if not equal to other width.

I think this will be close to it barring any user feedback or bugs, if nothing comes to
mind within a few days, I'll move the number to the new major version, 2.2.0

Version: 2.1.92
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-08-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is closer to final release. Removed Bank/Slot separate
items and am now just generating one: Locator item, usually from Slot/DIMM locator info,
but sometimes from Bank Locator info when it is more reliable based on my data samples.

Updated help menu, updated man page, now shows working -x -xx -xxx extra data. This may
change slightly over time.

Also removed speed output when No Module Installed is returned for device size. This
also wills switch off width if both total/data are empty.

This is much closer now to live 2.2.0, but I'll leave a few more tests before putting
it at 2.2.0.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Finally, after all these years, initial memory/ram
support. This feature requires dmidecode, and usually that needs to be run as root.

Significantly improved dmidecode error handling and output, and have as 2.1.90 testing/initial
release basic ram data. 

In subsequent releases, extra info for -x and -xx and -xxx will be added as well to the output.

For those who want to jump on board early for ram data, update your repos, for those who want to
wait for the full featured version, with -x type data, wait for 2.2.0

have the odd feature in our test data of having > 1 IF id, like ib0 ib1 per pcibusid.

Added support for virtual nics as well. This required refactoring the networking functions
significantly, so hopefully nothing breaks for existing systems. It should in theory be more
robust now than it was before, with more accurate output, particularly with multiple port
devices, like two port nics etc.

Version: 2.1.27
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-05-02
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Should be almost no changes for linux platforms, though I 
added in an abstracted kernel_compiler method, not just gcc, that may work on freebsd,
and in the future, it may also work if distros or kernel people start using either
clang or LLVM-GCC or LLVM for compiling linux kernels. I'd need some data sets to
show that however before adding that full linux kernel support, but the framework
is now there.

That continues the abstraction of certain features, like kernel compiler, init system,
display server. Display server still needs full data sets from mir/wayland, at least
wayland, and the bsd display servers as well, I have no idea how to get that data
at this point, but the starting framework is present anyway for that time I get
those datasets.

Almost all these changes are for darwin osx, and that is about all I will do for that
junky broken platform, they have no tools, they have no discipline when it comes to
following unix like conventions, they even use spaces in program names, like windows.

Given it has no native lspci or pciconf tool that I am aware of, or dmesg.boot, 
there's little point in putting more time into it. dmidecode does not run on darwin,
so there's nothing to learn there either, you can get a silly 3rd party program to
generate a dmidecode.bin data file that dmidecode can then read, but since that
requires not one, but two third party programs be installed, that's not going to
happen.

Next time an osx user calls this system 'unix' I will laugh.

Version: 2.1.24
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-04-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is an attempt to make -s accurate more of the time, 
particularly with fringe or broken sensors outputs. See inxi issue 58 for details.
http://code.google.com/p/inxi/issues/detail?id=58

Added temp3, and an override to capture cases where temp3 is the actual cpu temp.

Added PECI overrides for cases like msi/asus mobos have defective CPUTIN return data.

Added core0 overrides as well, for cases where the temp returned is too low.

It is absolutely 100% guaranteed that these changes will break some outputs that were
working, but it's also certain that I believe that more wrong outputs will be corrected.

With sensors, really the only way you can get reliable sensors is to use the lm-sensors
config files for your motherboard, then set: CPU: temp and MB: temp explicitly.

inxi will always use CPU: or MB: to override anything found.

Version: 2.1.22
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-04-27
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. A bug fix for btrfs, which does not internally use /dev/sdx[number]
to identify a partition, but rather the basic /dev/sdc for example.

This made -D show wrong disk used percentage.

Also, I added --total for df that have that supported, there is however an oddity which you
can see here:

df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
--exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
awk 'BEGIN {total=0} !/total/ {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'
result:
614562236

df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
--exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
awk 'BEGIN {total=0} /^total/ {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

result:
614562228

 df  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
 --exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
 --exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
 awk 'BEGIN {total=0} {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

 result:
 614562236
 
 In my tests, using --total gives a greater disk user percentage than adding the results
 up manually, as inxi did before, and still does for systems without --total for df.
 
 df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \

Strange, no? the data is in blocks, and it should of course in theory add up to exactly the
same thing. However, because --total lets df do the math, I'm going to use that for now,
unless someone can show it's not good.

inxi still falls back for bsds and older df to the standard method.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This fixes one small oversight, placing USB in front of ID-[x] 
of disk drive lists. Was showing USB ID-1: /dev/sde now shows: ID-1: USB /dev/sde
that is more intuitive and keeps the columns in alignment more or less, easier
to read.

Second, fixes a bug with some file systems / usb drives
where they do not use usb- in the /dev/disk/by-id line but only wwn-
https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en
-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Online_Storage_Reconfiguration_Guide/persistent_naming.html
explains it somewhat.

the fix is adding a second if null test of the device /dev/sdx in by-path, that seems 
to fix the issue. by-path does have the usb- item, though it does not have the name
so it's not as reliable in absolute terms, but it's fine as a second step fallback 
option.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
While this release has some new features, they are all intended for development use
for the next major feature, -m / memory, so there is no particular reason to package
this release. There is a new development option, -! 33, which lets me override /sys
data use for -M, which is useful to debug dmidecode output for -m and other features.

No new version, new man. There may be a few more of these releases, but functionally
there is no particular reason to make a new package if you are a maintainer, so there
is no new version number. This release is a preparation for some branches/one/inxi
tests that will be run in the future.

The man/help document -! 33 just to have it there, but it should make no difference
to anyone but me at this stage.

New version/tarball. This completes, I think, the line wrap update. -o is now handled,
unmounted drives.

IMPORTANT: some distros use inxi for detecting partitions, the syntax on the following 
have changed slightly:

HDD: per drive changes from: 1: id: to ID-1:
Partitions: per partition changes from ID: to ID-1:
Unmounted partitions: per unmounted changes from ID: to ID-1

You see the pattern, they are all the same now, and they are all numbered. I think this
is easier to read when scanning long lines of drives/partitions, or even short ones.

Also fixed a long standing oddity, not a bug, but for some weird reason, -p did not
include the location, like /dev/sda1, unless -l or -u were used. That makes no sense
so I have moved the dev/remote location output to standard -p/-P

Except for bug fixes, this completes the overally line wrap update, all lines wrap,
you can set widths with -y now, and the old issue of not fitting nicely into 80 column
wide widths is solved. Note that in some areas, p/P for example, at times if the mount
point or remote location is very long the line may still wrap, but making this perfect
is too convoluted so I'm calling it good enough now, all lines are handled reasonably well,
certainly radically better than before 2.1.0.

Version: 2.1.17
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-04-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Added -y [integer >= 80] option. This allows for absolute override
of width settings. This overrides any dynamically detected widths, as well as the globals:
COLS_MAX_CONSOLE='115'
COLS_MAX_IRC='105'
Now that inxi widths are largely dynamic in terminal, with a few lingering exceptions, it made sense
to also allow for overrides of this. This is useful in cases where for example you want to output
inxi to text file or for other purposes, or if you just want to test the widths, as in my case.

-y cannot be used with --recommends, but otherwise it works fine, with --help/-c 94-99 you have to 
put -y first in the list of options.

Example: inxi -v7 -y150 > inxi.txt will ignore the terminal settings and output the lines at basically
max length.

Patch: 00
Date:  2014-04-02
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This fix only impacts bsd sed, but it fixes the line length failure
issue because bsd sed doesn't work with \x1b, but it does when you do:
ESC=$(echo | tr '\n' '\033' )
I found this trick on:
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42321/how-can-i-instruct-bsd-sed-to-interpret-escape-sequences-like-n-and-t

No other changes. Non bsd users, you can ignore this.

Version: 2.1.15
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-04-01
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version/tarball. This corrects some subtle issues with line wraps:

Audio -A - now wrap is fully dynamic down to 80 characters, and also the expansion of ALSA
to Advanced Linux Sound System only happens if that fits in the display width.

-N/-n/-i - Most networking/ip address stuff wraps now.

-d - optical drive data wraps better now too.

This more or less completes the line wrap redo.

Version: 2.1.14
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-03-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version/tarball. Tiny fix in debugger, it turns out that in some systems, the command:
strings --version used in the debugger results in a hang, which you can duplicate with:
strings 
alone, without any argument or info, that will hang too, so I assume if the system doesn't
have the --version parameter, strings ignores that, and basically just does what it would do
with no option, hang.

Thanks for user ypharis persistence in tracking down this issue. So far only appeared on slackware
based distros, but since the debugger should 'just work', removing the version test.

-----------------------------------

methods:
something <<<  $variable is signficantly slower than: echo $variable | something
so I replaced almost all instances of <<< with echo ...|

I've seen speed differences of up to 10% but it's not consistent, so this is just 
something to boost performance slightly on older systems I'd guess.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Added dynamic wrapping to -G, and also am now wrapping -C per cpu cores speeds, 
for systems with a lot of them, that will clean up the output.

Added dynamic wrapping to --recommends and -c 94-99.

These are the main things, there's a few smaller issues with -xx output on -N/-n/-i but
those will noly really show with full output and it takes a while to get this stuff stable
so maybe some other time, but it's ok for now.

Version: 2.1.7
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-03-18
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, attempt 2 at detecting all possible syntaxes for cards. Now using
the bus id itself to determine if the 
VGA compatible controller
3D controller
Display Controller
refer to separate chips or the same one.

Bus id gives the data needed, because the video chip, the real card, that is,
is on for example 00:05.0 the trailing .0 is the key, that's the actual card.

The audio or display controller for the same card would be for example: 00:05.1

I don't know if this is fully reliable, but it will have to do, either some cards
as is get missed, or some cards get double id'ed, unless I use a hack like this.

There's nothing else I can find but the bus id to determine that it's the same
physical device or not.

Version: 2.1.3
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-03-15
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Big set of changes: changed all ver: and version: to v:; changed all bash
${var} to $var where appropriate to avoid extra overhead of ${..}; removed 'basename'
and replaced with ${path##*/} which avoids unnessary subshells.

Fixed dynamic line wraps on -I and -S lines, now those in most cases will work well 
down to 80 cols. 

Fixed bug in optical drives, at some point in the last few years, the kernel in /sys
changed the path to the optical drive data, added in /ata8/ (example) so both methods
are now handled. This should fix a lot of failures to show optical drive brand name etc.

Added weechat detection, trying also supybot/limnoria detection in irc client version.
There was weechat-curses, but I guess they finally dropped the -curses. Limnoria is
a fork of supybot but still uses the supybot program name, but added in limnoria too
if they get around to changing that.

More dynamic sizing tweaks, more optimization of code. Discovered that dipping into gawk
is almost 250x more expensive in terms of execution time than using bash variable. 
Will change to use bash directly as time goes along where it's safe and accurate.

Added handling to support /run paths using directories, like /run/gdm/gdm.pid for dm data.

Version: 2.1.1
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-03-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New Version, new man. This continues the dyanamic line sizing, I'm doing these one at a
time to make it easier to test stuff one by one.

Full refactoring/reordering of top global variables, moved user/maintainer set variables
to top, and clearly identify all globals.

Changed LINE_MAX to COL_MAX but all user configuration files will stay working since
inxi now will check for that and translate them to the new variable names.

New lines fixed, -C cpu and -f cpu plus full flags. Flags output is now fully dynamic to
display screen in terminal/console. Moved cpu short flags to -x because it's not that
important in general and just clutters things  up in my opinion.

Print flags/bogomips on separate line if line greater than display width.

The rest of the lines will get a similar treatment, but it takes a bit of trial and error
for each line to get it working right.

Note that IRC line lengths are NOT dyanamic unless I can find a way to determine the column
width of irc clients, but that won't be accurate since fonts vary in widths for each character.

CPU was the worst offender in my opinion in terms of regular output wrapping to new line messily,
next will be the things with ports/chip id/card id.

Tightened up a bit more the dyanamic help / version output handler.

Version: 2.0.0
Patch: 00
Date:  2014-03-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New feature, not new line option though. Now shows init type with -x (also shows rc
type if openrc). -xx shows init / rc version number. Change runlevel to target if
systemd and if non numeric runlevel given. Should support systemd/upstart/epoch/runit
sysvinit. Supports openrc as extra data if it's present. Rearranged -I line a bit but
really just exchanged Runlevel: for Init: v: Runlevel: default:

This is the first step, some of the init system ID methods are weak and non robust
and this may need to be revised, but it should for now identify systemd/upstart quite
accurately, and in most cases sysvinit. Note that to get sysvinit version number requires
tool: strings which in debian/ubuntu is in package binutils. I don't know the package names
for arch/fedora/etc for the recommends check tool in inxi yet.

I believe this will be good enough for a first draft version, but over time we'll get it
more fine tuned, but as it is now, it should cover at least 99% of users, which isn't bad.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Fixed new gnome change, they, of course, removed gnome-about
and so version numbers failed. Now first trying gnome-session to get version number.

Also, there's a bug in at least gtk detection in opensuse, not sure what it is, they could
be using a different syntax for the test:
pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0

returns no such package on gnome 3.10 installs, but I have no idea what package name to
test for there in this case.

So leaving gtk version bugs unhandled due to no user information or feedback, if you want
it fixed or if it works for your distro, let me know and also if it does not work, tell
me the correct commmand, with its output, to get gtk version.

That's for inxi -Sx output that is.

Patch: 00
Date:  August 12 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Fixed a bug in Xorg where it shows drivers as unloaded when they
are actually loaded. Since we can't fix xorg, inxi will try to work around this bug by validating
one step further in the Xorg.0.log data, to confirm that drivers noted as loaded/unloaded/failed are 
actually running the display(s) of the system.

There is a possible case of error that might happen due to this change in the case of a system with
a complex xorg that uses two drivers/modules to run two different displays, ie, nvidia on one, and amd
on the other, for example, or intel/nvidia, etc. However, if that bug appears, we'll get that data set
of debugging output and fix it at that point. 

This fix repairs an existing xorg bug that is unlikely to get fixed any time soon (the call to load the
detected drivers, eg, vesa, intel, is repeated, causing a failure of driver already loaded on the second
occurance.

Added some flags passed to various cpu functions and better detections of ARM cpu to handle dual core and other
issues that were not handled before as well, or at all.

Version: 1.9.10
Patch: 00
Date:  June 19 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Another stab at finally fixing the cpu / core count failures on fringe
cases. This required fixing some core logic assumptions that are not currently correct, particularly
on two cases, some xeon cpus fail to show core id for each core, showing 0 for all of them, second,
vm cpus do not show physical ids at all for at least intel, nor do they show core id. 

While we can't get HT totally reliable, particularly for vm xeon, since inxi has no way to know in
that case if a core is attached to a physical core or a virtual one, all of them being virtual in that
case, but still inxi is now reporting the correct number of cores, or threads in vm xeons, and is not
showing multicore cpus as single core, which was the main issue.

This required redoing the counter logic for the cpu/core/physical arrays, now they are set independently,
and can handle any of the others not being set, without creating an error or failure condition.

Also added in last check for a certain intel case where core id is 0 but > 1 physical cores exist, that
now also shows the correct cpu / core count.

While this is tested on many data sets of proc cpuinfo, it's still possible there is a fringe case I have
not seen that will trigger yet another unexpected behavior.

Date:  June 16 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, new tarball. Added support for openSUSE repo syntax/location, as long as it's
zypp or yum it will work. If it's both then it will show only one I believe, if that's a possible scenario, no idea.

Added one more fix for those pesky intel vm cpu core errors, now if /proc/cpuinfo shows no siblings at all,
and no core_id, but does have physical id, it will use the count for physical id as a default for core count.

Not perfect, but better than calling a dual core cpu a single core.

There's still a lot of mysteries with vm versions of kvm cpus, for example, if you see a dual core xeon, is
that actually one core with ht, or two cores? There is no way to find that information out that I can see that is
reliable.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Some subtle bug fixes, a kvm virtual machine uses disk id in 
/proc/partitions of 253, which made the disk totals fail to show up at all. Added that in.

Moved sourcing of configuration files to right after initialize_data so that some variables
can be forced to different values before the next set of system/app checks.

This is to allow specifically turning off, for some headless servers where $DISPLAY is not
null due to a bash configuration bug, these:
B_SHOW_X_DATA='false'
B_RUNNING_IN_X='false'

Setting those two to false in inxi.conf will turn off all the X checks etc even if the $DISPLAY
is set to non null.

Added in support for ksplice kernel version, requires installed uptrack-uname, if that is
present and if uptrack-name kernel version is different from uname then it will add (ksplice)
to kernel version string, and use ksplice kernel version. Also created a single function
get_kernel_version for use by short form/long form inxi output.

For intel xeon cpus, trying a work around for a bug in /proc/cpuinfo which fails to show core_id
or physical_id for cpus, using siblings / 2 for xeons with no actual core counts.

Fixed a bug that made fixes for multimounted partitions fail for disk used. Added in support
for also excluding single partitions mounted to different places.

Also fixed grsec kernel different handling of partitions in /proc/partition and df -hTP, doesn't use
standard partition numbering. This can't be perfect because inxi cannot know what the actual 
disk sizes are, but it's an ok guess. example: /dev/xvdac (uses 'c' instead of '3' for partition,
and does not show anything for disk itself.

Version: 1.9.7
Patch: 00
Date:  May 25 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New tarball, version, man page. Improved remote weather, now it uses -W, and deprecated -! location=..

That was too hard to type and too hard to remember. Also do more dyanamic reordering of weather
output, depending on how much data is present, and how many x options are used.

Added error handling for generic deprecated options, and for options that do not have the correct
syntax for OPTARG, like with -W.

This should about do it for the weather option for now unless I missed something somewhere.

Patch: 00
Date:  May 17 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Unless disabled by distribution maintainers, offers
weather -w option. With -x, -xx-, -xxx, shows more information. Basic line is just weather
and system time there. -x adds time zone, which is useful for servers, particurly web servers.
-x also adds wind speed. -xx adds humidity and barometric pressure. -xxx adds a possible new line, 
if data is available, heat index, wind chill, and dew point. 
-xxx also adds a line for location (blocked by irc/-z) / weather observation time.

-z filter applies as usual to location data, removes it in irc by default. -Z overrides override.

The api this uses is probably going to be dropped at some point, so this is just going to work 
while it works, then it will need to be updated at some point, so don't get very attached to it.

Also adds option to, with -w: -! location=<location string>
This lets users send an alternate location using either <city,state> or <postal code>
or <latitude,longitude> (commas for city,state and latitude,longitude are not optional, and the order
must be as listed.

If There is a developer flag if distro maintainers do not want this enabled, simply set:
B_ALLOW_WEATHER='false'
before packaging and the weather feature will be disabled.

Version: 1.8.46
Patch: 00
Date:  May 3 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Fixed a small issue that would create a wrong reporting of disk
useage if bind mounts are used, ie, multiple binds to a single mount. Now inxi will
check a list of the previously used partitions before adding the size of the used space
to the total used, if the partition has already been used it will skip it. This was/is
a quick and dirty fix, but it's totally fine I believe and should resolve two separate 
issues:

1. use of bind mount method, where multiple partition names are bound to the same partition
2. accidental dual mounting to the same partition.

partitions section will still show the same data, ie, if bind is used, it will show all
the bind mounts even when they are attached/bound to a partition that is already listed.
This seems useful information, though maybe we can get the key word 'bind' in there somehow,
but for now I won't worry about that issue, that's just a nice to have, not a bug.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. As always with fixes, one thing creates a bug in another. Fixed
linux driver version handling, now only trimming off number from bsd drivers.

Some linux drivers, like tg3 for broadcom ethernet, have numbers ending them. So this is
a bug fix for 1.8.44 release mainly.

Also includes openbsd initial fixes for some issues related to sysctl parsing for cpu and ram.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This version brings the -A, -G, -N, -n, -i pci data
to bsd. Using a pciconf parser to do most of the heavy lifting in this one.

Two functions do the main pci card processing for audio, graphics, and networking.

All seems to be shipshape and working, tested on freebsd 7.3, 9.0, and 9.1 and 
the output is consistent.

Version: 1.8.43
Patch: 00
Date:  February 28 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Improved B_ALLOW_UPDATES handling, now if set to false,
turns off all -h and -H menu options for updating. Also triggers an error message
if you use -U or -! <10-16/http://>.

Distro maintainers, take note, if you used the B_ALLOW_UPDATES flag, you no longer
need to change the code anywhere, the error messages and blocking the -h output for
update features is automatic as soon as the flag is set to 'false'.

I needed to change the -! handling because -! is now also being used for extra features 
like -! 31 and -! 32 and probably more stuff in the future, plus the -! 30 used by 
things like the inxi gui tool being worked on by trash80.

Also included in this version are more bsd changes, including initial function for pciconf
data parsing, this will be used for -A, -G, and -N options for card data.

Further bsd improvements are better error/no data available messages for -D and -o.

Updated help and man page to reflect the difference between -R, -Rx, and -Rxx output for

Date:  February 18 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, updated man page, new tarball.

Fixed partition bug that could falsely identify a remote filesystem like nfs as /dev fs

Added two options: 
-! 31 - Turns off Host section of System line. This is useful if you want to post output
from server without posting its name.
-! 32 - Turns on Host section if it has been disabled by user configuration file
B_SHOW_HOST='false'

Added missing CPU data message, fixed missing cpu cache/bogomips output, turned off
bogomips if null for bsd systems because bogomips is a linux kernel feature.

Added N/A for no memory report, this would mainly hit bsd systems where user has no
permissions to use sysctl or has no read rights for /var/run/dmesg.boot.

Many fixes for partitions, now for bsd, if available, uses gpart list to get uuid/label
Added support for raid file system syntax in bsd, now excludes main raid device name, 
and adds a flag to raiddevice/partitionname type so output can identify it as a raid
slice/partition.

In man page, added -! 31 / -! 32 sections, and some other small edits.

Added bsd raid line error message, added bsd sensors line error message.

Many other small bug fixes that should make linux more robust in terms of missing
data, and better/cleaner output for bsd.

New tarball. Tiny fix for an obscure fringe case, leaving numbering as is.

In some cases, dmidecode returns the grammatically wrong message: 
'No smbios nor dmi data' instead of 'No smbios or dmi data', corrected the search
to look for simpler: 'no smbios ' to avoid that random error.

Version: 1.8.37
Patch: 00
Date:  February 11 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This update fixes a recent bug report with ancient dmidecode versions, that do not
properly support the -s option. Now -M uses only one method for dmidecode, manual construction of the Machine
data from the raw dmidecode file. The file output is also parsed a bit to make it more consistently reliable
for inxi purposes.

This update also includes all recent bsd branch updates, including the new #!/usr/bin/env bash on top which
lets inxi run in any environment without changes. Also for bsd, sets sed -i/sed -i '' global value, which 
means that now all the branches are the same, except the bsd branches will contain the most recent tests
and bsd handling. 

As each step is reached, I'll release a new inxi that should be stable, this is the first one however that
can be used as is, no changes, for bsd, debian kfreebsd, and linux systems.

Pleasen note that most bsd features are either incomplete or missing completely at this point, but it's a
start.

Some initial changes as well to help options to show more correct linux or bsd terms. These will be updated
as time permits, it is a long process.

Version: 1.8.36
Patch: 00
Date:  February 8 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. All bug fixes and cleanup preparing to support bsd systems, including
kfreebsd from Debian.

Cleaned up all sed and grep that will be used by bsds, added more granular flag for bsd types.

Cleaned up and corrected issues between bsd/linux, more escapes and tests added to drop error
counts in bsds. 

Please note that you must use the inxi from branches/bsd for true bsds because sed has extra -i ''
added, and has the proper #!/usr/local/bin/bash

Added -! 16 for gnubsd download/update, that's for gnu bsd systems like gnu/kfreebsd from debian.

That retains the top #!/bin/bash path, and also uses gnu sed so no -i '' syntax.

Moved some grep -o to gawk or sed to avoid using gnu grep unnecessarily, leaving gnu grep where
it will be linux only, for example parsing a /proc file.

Fixed tty irc bugs for bsds and linux, now should show the right console size for both, ideally.

Version: 1.8.35
Patch: 00
Date:  February 7 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Note, this is a refactor release only, and features the core bsd
support built in, although inxi will not run in bsd unless the top: #!/bin/bash is changed
to #!/usr/local/bin/bash

The actual bsd branch can be grabbed from: 
http://inxi.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd/inxi
then you can keep that version updated using: inxi -! 15 
which will grab the latest bsd version from the svn server.

This release also fixes a lot of small bugs that testing for bsd support exposed, but functionally
most people should see no difference, I just want to get this version up because there are
so many small changes that it's worth having a release.

I was going to have the fixed dmidecode for old systems in 1.8.35 but that will have to wait til
1.8.36

Linux users should see no real changes, except maybe a thing or two will work in certain circumstances 
when it didn't before, like showing MHz on ARM cpus on short inxi.

-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Fixed an old bug where if you start inxi with
an ssh command sometimes it will not show any client information, just the debugger 
PPID output. Now it will test as a final check to see if it can detect any parent to
the process. Actually grandparent I believe. Seems to work, it's a fringe case but
why not handle it?

New -xx feature, for -I it will show, if inxi is not running in IRC client and if 
is running in X, and if the grandparent is not 'login', will show the application
the shell is running in.

Patch:  00
Date: January 22 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New Version, new tarball. Added inxi.changelog to tarball as well.

Continuing fixes for ARM cpus, it was noted that short form inxi failed to show cpu speed
derived from bogomips. That's because of the old min/max output that short form used.

Updated that section to now use N/A as flag, and if N/A for min/max speed, use the speed
given from first cpu array index, the one derived from bogomips for ARM/razberry pi.

Note that there is still no other ARM /proc/cpuinfo available to see if the razberry pi
fixes work for all ARM cpus, but the fixes will stop hangs and endless loops at worst,
and may also show some type of cpu speeds for ARM cpus that are not in razpi devices.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
Bug fix, new version, new tarball.

quick work around fix for razberrie pi, get cpu data hung on arm /proc/cpuinfo because
it doesn't use the standard processor : [digit] format, but uses a string in the
processor : field, which then hangs inxi which was expecting an integer.

Corrected this with a work around, but it will require a lot more ARM /proc/cpuinfo samples
before the support for ARM can be considered stable.

For cpu speed, following wikipedia, used bogomips being equal to 1x cpu speed, to derive cpu speed.

Better than nothing I guess, but will be wrong in other cases, particularly with dual core arm.
